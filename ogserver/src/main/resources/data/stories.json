  "blog_content": "<p><strong>Expert Speak:</strong> The L-shaped kitchen lends itself to multiple permutations and combinations allowing you to showcase what you would like to in your kitchen space.</p><p>The L-shaped kitchen is a popular <strong>modular kitchen</strong> option these days. In larger homes, or those with the apartment floor space to accommodate such a kitchen, these are standard. The benefit of having an L-shaped kitchen is that the legs of the L may be manipulated to suit your specific needs. The same may be done with the overhead kitchen cabinets and shelves. If you are planning to go in for an L-shaped kitchen, here are ways you can make it work for you.</p><p><strong>Show off Your Crockery:</strong> If you do not require an expansive kitchen, and have an amazing collection of crockery that you have nowhere to keep, you may want to consider this option. Reduce the leg of your kitchen on one end. In the space saved install a large display cabinet where all your crockery may go. This gives you space to show off your best, within a perfectly functional <strong>kitchen interior</strong>. The cabinet may be designed to blend in with the rest of your kitchen\\u2019s theme.</p><p><strong>Move an Element Away: </strong>You may be the kind of cook who likes a wide space to work in. The legs of the L may not give you all that you need. In such cases, consider removing an element \\u2013 the kitchen sink and placing it on an island in the center of the kitchen. This gives you more work space. It also creates the perfect work triangle, accommodating 2 to 3 people at a time in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>Get More Storage Space:</strong> There is a general feeling, that no matter how big your kitchen, it is never going to be enough. If you do not have all the storage space you need, you could consider installing a pot rack over your island. You may also consider going vertical with your cabinetry. Each of these options gives you ample space, even for your large vessels, making complete use of all your space aesthetically.</p><p><strong>Work with Your Space:</strong> There are a few kitchens that have a unique design that calls for breaking the L. You can make this work in multiple ways. A door way coming in between can house your storage shelves on one end and your working/cooking space on the other. An island can take care of the sink and dining space. Alternately, a break in the walls may be utilized to place a tall cabinet that serves as a partition to the dining room and gives you storage space.</p><p>The L-shaped kitchen is the most flexible of <strong>modular kitchen designs</strong> and plays to the tunes of your interior designer. Work with them today to get the most unique setting for yourself.</p>  ",

  "blog_content": "<p><strong>Expert Speak:</strong> The straight kitchen lends itself to numerous variations, each of which may be manipulated to suit your specific sense of aesthetics and practicality.</p><p>Your straight <strong>modular</strong> <strong>kitchen</strong> is designed to save space and give you the best that a modular kitchen has to offer. In fact, this is a model of kitchen often opted for in larger homes as well, to facilitate the accommodation of a dining space. There are several ways to stylize your straight kitchen. Here are some ideas to inspire you:</p><p><strong>Save Space:</strong> If you are looking to include a straight kitchen in a small space, you will want to make the most of storage. Have your cabinets, ideally a mix of closed and open, go all the way up your wall. This way, you can store larger vessels and those you don\\u2019t use regularly, higher up. You may also consider creating wall-mounted options for your larger <strong>kitchen appliances</strong>. Another option, would be to build space for appliances into your straight kitchen cabinetry. This would probably work if you live alone or are a new couple setting up home.</p><p><strong>Create a Galley:</strong> A straight kitchen may also be introduced into a large space. In such cases you may consider adding in a kitchen island to help create a triangle for working \\u2013 cleaning, prepping and cooking. It also forms a galley where you can walk down a corridor of sorts, adding to the charm of your kitchen.</p><p><strong>Go Sleek:</strong> The benefit of a straight <strong>modular kitchen design</strong> is that it occupies a minimal amount of space. That being said you may work your space to look glamorous and sleek. For example, consider interspersing empty space between each part of your triangular work area. This you can use to decorate your kitchen or simply to give you more space to maneuver. Bring in a low hanging light or one that you can alter in terms of height to change the look of your kitchen space.</p><p><strong>Go Artistic:</strong> Turn your straight kitchen into a quirky space of art and craft. Bring in artistic elements with the kitchen as a theme and watch it all come to life. This works especially well if you have a lot of natural light coming into the kitchen. Alternately you may consider adding in-cabinet lights or small light fixtures to do up your space.</p><p>The straight kitchen is often perceived as a <strong>modular kitchen</strong> that has little scope for manipulation. Fact is, sky is the limit when it comes to designing this space.</p>  ",

  "blog_content": "<p><strong>Expert Speak: </strong>Ideally a wardrobe is considered a boring piece of furniture. The uneventful custodian of your precious clothes and all other knick knacks those are dear to you. Would you not like the wardrobe to be more than a drab object in the corner of your room\\u2026 more than just a storage unit? That\\u2019s what the experts think. Among all furniture, wardrobes probably have the highest utility quotient and a comparatively lower aesthetic value. Modern home makers today, however, look for wardrobes that are a combination of both; wardrobes that can put a smile on their face every time.</p><p>One such smile-worthy solution can be found in mirrored wardrobes, with sliding doors. When designed to cover the breadth of one wall in the room, with sleeker compartment space, these can add beautifully to the aesthetics of your living space. To ensure that these wardrobes snugly fit into your room, they are made according to the overall height and width of the actual aperture you wish to install the wardrobe into.</p><p><strong>Here are 5 ways in which mirror fa\\xe7ade wardrobes with sliding doors can be a blessing:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Larger rooms beyond dimensions:</strong> Of course it\\u2019s an optical illusion, but mirrors can do wonders in making your room look bigger. Be it natural lighting or artificial, if the wardrobes are placed along the largest wall, the room can be tricked into looking double its actual size.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Maximum space utility.</strong> Since these wardrobes cover the breadth of a wall, the depth can be kept minimal with ideal compartment sizes. Sliding doors further reduce the use of floor space at all times. This increases your room\\u2019s floor space. A room that is less stuffy is naturally good for uplifting your spirits. This gives you enough space in the room for walking around, or decorating with a carpet for floor works, or even a dance or zumba practice stage! You have the studio like wall mirror already; why not make the best out of it!</p></li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Light, light everywhere!</strong> Again, with large mirrors, the room looks brighter. Placed at right angles to natural lighting and you can maximize the amount of light in the room beautifully. Bright room = happy people!</p></li></ol><ol start=\"4\"><li><p><strong>Hassle free access:</strong> sliding doors, unlike hinged doors, provide easy access to all sections of the wardrobe, without having to open and close multiple compartments. And since there aren\\u2019t any swinging doors to tackle, you can reach every nook and cranny with ease.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"5\"><li><p><strong>Personalized fa\\xe7ade designs:</strong> Not unlike wood, mirrored sliding doors have multiple styling and personalizing options too. You can choose plain full size mirrors with trims, tracks or panels. You can also look at lacquered glass, colored glass, shaded glass, partly frosted mirrors, or a combination of styles to suit your taste.</p></li></ol><p>We believe in showering compliments, be it to a beautiful woman or gifted chef! The receivers are always happy and always reciprocate with perks. Well, choosing the right furniture is like complimenting your home. And the perk is - waking up to a beautiful house that gives you a sense of accomplishment. Try it!</p>  ",

These islands come in a range of sizes and may be used in multiple ways to add utility to a kitchen. If you like the idea of having an island in your kitchen there are a few things you will need to keep in mind when making a choice. Here are some questions you need to figure out:</p><p><strong>Functionality:</strong> The first thing you need to figure out is the functionality of your island in your modular kitchen design. Do you want it for additional cooking space, to put in a sink or perhaps just as a dining table option. There are several ways in which you may also achieve a combination of all of these requirements. Understanding the purpose it serves, will give you an idea on how big your island must be and whether you kitchen can actually accommodate it.</p><p><strong>Integrating Appliances:</strong> You may want to use your kitchen island to integrate all of your large appliances. In that case, your designer will have to think of modular storage options and well as drawing power lines to the center of the kitchen. You may consider making it a completely functional space by including your sink, the trash bins and some storage space for your appliances, all in one compact space.</p><p><strong>Additional Storage:</strong> The great thing about an island in <strong>kitchen designs</strong> is that it can be utilized in multiple ways. In a large L-shaped kitchen, the island may simply serve as a storage unit. Each wall of the unit can be uniquely designed to accommodate a variety of things. You may also have pull-out shelves for large appliances. The counter-top may be used to lay out a meal or simply as a space to dine at.</p><p><strong>Height of the Island:</strong> The height of your island is determined by what you are going to use it for. Remember that its height can affect the entire look of your kitchen. Ideally have your interior designer look through the space and ascertain what best may work for your kitchen. Based on the dimensions available you may have to tailor the design of the island a bit.</p><p>A kitchen island is a great way to add a dimension to the utility and <strong>designs of kitchen</strong>.

Modular furniture promises a combination of style and flexibility. Here are some of the advantages of a modular wardrobe.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Uses Space Efficiently</strong>: With skyrocketing real estate prices, it would be a shame to waste even an inch of your new apartment.

It can be installed in a few hours, saving you a lot of your productive time.</p></li></ol><p><em>You\\u2019ve bought a home you love. At myGubbi, we design furniture you deserve.</em></p>  ",

Its basic designs enables you to manipulate the design to your personal liking and needs.</p><p>Modular kitchens are a great way of doing up your kitchen space. The L-shaped kitchen is perhaps the most popularly opted for model of them all. The great part is that each of these kitchens may be designed to suit needs that may be integral to your style of cooking and your family\\u2019s needs. You may also consider bringing in the expertise of an interior designer and customizing the aesthetics of your <strong>L-shaped modular kitchen</strong>, especially if you have a small space to begin with. Here are some ways in which you can do this:</p><p><strong>Go High with Your Ceiling Cabinets: </strong>A regular L-shaped kitchen will provide you with a great set of <strong>kitchen storage cabinets</strong>, overhead and down below. If you have additional storage requirements, you can consider extending your overhead cabinets all the way to the ceiling. Here is where you can place delicate crockery that you use occasionally. You may also consider placing in your large vessels or those cooking basics that are not utilized on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Add in Kitchen Islands:</strong> Many are of the opinion that the kitchen island is only to be placed in the center. While that is the most common placement for it, it may also be added in as an extension to your kitchen, or be placed a little away from the modular set up of your kitchen. To this island you may push off a kitchen sink, or a prep area or even an additional storage space. The unit may also be used to house a wine rack or a small refrigerator.</p><p><strong>Brighten Up the Space:</strong> One of the ways to improve on the aesthetics of a small L-shaped kitchen is to brighten up your space. Go vibrant with your choice of wall colors or textures. Let this be a shade that stands apart from the rest of your home. If you have the provision to do so \\u2013 include as many skylights as possible. This will illuminate your space naturally, making your kitchen a comfortable space to retreat too every day.</p><p>The kitchen is a space that has the potential of becoming the most favored spot in a house. It is the heart of every home and the space from which all good things come. Every occasion \\u2013 good or bad can be made better with a great meal. In fact, the very act of cooking can be a soothing one. Create an <strong>L-shaped kitchen design</strong> that embodies your very spirit each time you step into it.</p>  ",

  "blog_content": "<p><strong>Expert Speak:</strong> The L-shaped kitchen is a basic design that lends itself to several variations. This provides it a flexibility which every end user may use to their benefit.</p><p>Over the years, the average home has evolved. While every room in the house has its own specific function, many a time you see an overlap. The bedroom doubles up to a living space; the study comes with an attached gym and today, the kitchen is a place for socialization. As far as modular kitchen designs go, the L-shaped kitchen is by far the most popular. Interior designers have been able to manipulate the design to suit various aesthetic and practical needs. If you are in the process of planning your kitchen, here are some of the benefits of the <strong>L-shaped kitchen</strong>:</p><p><strong>The Perfect Work Triangle: </strong>The L-shaped modular kitchen keeps in mind the perfect work triangle equation. It is what makes this model the most efficient. A good work triangle allows you to easily maneuver between your prepping, cooking and cleaning areas. It also ensures that there is no overlap at all and that everything you need is close on hand.</p><p><strong>Several Entryways: </strong>The good thing about <strong>kitchen design in L-shape</strong> is that it is usually placed in recesses of the walls, which means it does not leave any dead spots. It makes use of all the space there is to utilize, thus giving you more room to accommodate people who want to help in the kitchen or simply hang out. Adding in an island also creates a galley, which works to streamline the traffic in your kitchen ensuring that nobody gets in the way.</p><p><strong>Open Living Spaces: </strong>Modern designs emphasize open living spaces. An L-shaped kitchen makes use only two walls, allowing for a good amount of space for all the traffic that you anticipate in the kitchen. It also allows you to create an open kitchen that can flow seamlessly into a separate dining space. Even the d\\xe9cor of your L-shaped kitchen may be created keeping in mind the rest of your house. You may have your kitchen completely stand out, or blend it in with the rest of the house. <br>The <strong>L-shaped kitchen interior design</strong> allows you to go with the times. It is a basic design that allows for a great deal of flexibility depending on what you place importance on. The legs of the L as well as the storage space included may be altered to suit a family\\u2019s specific needs and this is what makes it a great modular kitchen design option.</p>  ",

  "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>MDFs are a cost effective solution in modern day homes, for owners who look for comfort, functionality and design all bundled together.</p><p>We\\u2019re often consulted about the benefits of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboards) and are usually questioned about our preference of MDF over solid ply wood. Traditionally, when it comes to strength, sturdiness and durability, solid plywood is considered the ideal solution for your wardrobe. Plywood is also revered for its beautiful grains and natural tones. </p><p>However, when we talk about those qualities being catering to a contemporary audience, the MDF appears as a surprisingly good hero. Here are three ways how the hero shines. </p><b><li><p><b>Shrinkage / Expansion: </b>Solid wood contracts and expands when subjected to changes in humidity and heat. Especially when it comes to the Indian context, we\\u2019ve often noted the troubles of ill fitting doors during monsoons. We\\u2019ve heard of cases where users chip off pieces of the door\\u2019s edges only to find it shrunken and when the season turns. </p></li></b><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p>MDF in such cases performs better than plywood. Being made of recycled wood fibers and resins, MDF is a high grade composite material that can tackle changes in weather conditions without any side effects. They\\u2019re an automatic bonus for the construction team who can now incorporate seamless designs without having to leave breathing/ floating gaps. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><b><li><p><b>Maintenance: </b>The durability of a wooden wardrobe is always associated with high care and maintenance. What with the shrinkage / expansion, re-touching of top coats and even prevention from bug attacks. Now, these may not be frequent troubles, but with MDF these are non-existent. </p></li></b><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><b><li><p><b>Construction Feasibility: </b>MDF is usually readily available in much larger panel sizes (5\\u2019 by 12\\u2019 panels for example). This allows for flexibility in design and construction. Being a processed panel, they do not have natural grains on the surface which helps in joining panels. </p></li></b><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p>Don\\u2019t get us wrong, natural grains and knots are beautiful if you have a traditional look in mind. But when catering to a modern day home, we are talking about colors and finishing that are contemporary. Grains and knots have been known to bleed through paints and stain coatings. This is where MDF becomes a designer\\u2019s delight. </p><strong><strong></strong></strong><ol><li ><p><b>Design and Modification friendly</b>: Speaking of designer\\u2019s delight, handling a material that can be molded in different forms only help our creative juices flow faster and better. MDFs can be transformed into little pieces of art when it comes to finishing. Pre Lam, Post Form Lam, Foil, Poly-Gloss, 5Pc, HG Lacquer and Acrylic Veneer are some of the finishes to be considered. All you need to do is pick your product and think of a look. A quick consultation with our designers for color options and end designs, and you get yourself a wardrobe like none other. \\xa0</p></li></ol><p><strong>MDFs are a cost effective solution for modern day homes, with owners who look for comfort, functionality and design all bundled together.

With this done, the rest of your kitchen will fall in place. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p>While you may have chosen the perfect <b>modular kitchen</b> for you, narrowing down on the right finishes can be quite a task. The immense range to choose from, not to mention the fact that there is no such thing as a wrong choice, can make the decision all the more difficult to arrive at. Every kitchen is different, but there are a few basic points you may keep in mind when looking at finishes and <b>kitchen fittings</b>. </p><strong><strong><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0897/8058/files/SWAN.jpg?12242554365532794262\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong><p><b>Counter-tops:</b> Your counter-top is where most of the work for the day happens. It is also the most expansive part of your kitchen. You could begin making your choice from this large unit. Ideally stick to a single counter-top material. You may go in for solid granite or a range of composite materials. This will ensure that there are no deep lines on the stone and cleaning becomes an easy task. The only variation you could consider bringing in, is for the island or your pantry space. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p><b>Cabinets:</b> Your cabinets are where you should train your sights next. If you have a significantly large cabinet set up, you may want to begin with it, in terms of a finish choice. Keep your choice of materials minimalistic and simple. Ideal choice would be of marble and wood, with many people opting for slate as well. Limit your color palette to a maximum of two materials. Choose light-colored cabinetry and use small doses of another material to fill in space and add to its depth. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p><b>Contrast Finishes:</b> The key to making a visually appealing kitchen is to work with contrasts. If you have a dark counter-top, opt for light wall finishes around it. Alternate between a visually bright space and something more calm. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p>Once you have chosen materials for the largest components of your kitchen, you can then work on the floors as well as the accessories such as curtains, if any, and open shelving color. All of these various finishes will come together to form a seamless look for the <b>interior of your kitchen. </b></p><p><strong><br>It would be great if you allow an interior designer or a kitchen architect to work with you in creating the perfect space for you to cook for friends and family.</strong></p>  ",

This is mostly to create minimalistic designs that render comfort and class in one go. Following extensive research to gain product confidence we recommend a wall mounted wardrobe to our contemporary home owners. This is when we realize that there are inhibitions housed by the home owners about this wonderful piece of furniture and we though what better way to clear those doubts than to spell them out here!</p><p>Here are the 3 most common myths about a Wall Mounted Wardrobe:</p><p><b>Myth # 1. Wall mounted wardrobes are not sturdy and strong!</b></p><p><b>Truth:</b> cabinets and wardrobes are not just hung on nails and left for suspension like how you would a wall painting. These wardrobes are constructed on the wall with individual parts installed one after the other. These are fixed together while being nailed in and the support of the wall is utilized on all part of the structure. The right usage of material, such as in the case of MDF boards, would ensure that you have a non-bulky, sleek unit that can withstand a good amount of weight on its shelves. </p><p><b>Myth # 2: The bedroom wall will get destroyed and we cannot reuse it!</b></p><p><b>Truth: </b>The wardrobe is constructed on the wall, therefore, yes, there will be drill holes and shadows left once the wardrobe is dismounted. However, that doesn\\'t render the wall useless. A simple re-plastering is all it would take for the wall to look brand new again. Also, when finalizing the decor and look of the bedroom, the wardrobe is thought of as a primary component. A wall once selected for the wardrobe, be it placed or wall mounted, is seldom ever changed. Therefore you need not bother about recurring costs and move ahead with wall mounts without hesitations.</p><p><b>Myth # 3: Wall mounted wardrobes cannot be big in size!</b></p><p>There\\'s more to this myth, we\\'ve heard people complain about the fact that owing to its questionable sturdiness, wall mount units cannot be larger in size and they can only be considered for cabinets in kitchens and bathrooms. Now, everybody loves large wardrobes, so wall mounts are not considered a feasible option. </p><p><b>Truth: </b>To begin with, myGubbi has a live example to prove this myth wrong in its very unique and beautiful \\xa0Pheasant Wardrobe! With this full size wardrobe - eight feet in height, nine feet in width and 2 feet in depth - you won\\'t get a better myth breaker! When it comes to sturdiness, our note on myth # 1 should have helped in clearing doubts. However, you also get to consult our experts to get further information. </p><strong>Aesthetically these floating units create a magical feel to the space in your room. A wall mounted wardrobe would both free up space and add to the illusion of more space all at once. </strong>  ",

This is a kitchen that works in small and large spaces as well as uneven ones.</p><p><strong>U-shaped kitchens</strong> are a popular option in most homes today. If you are planning on bringing one into your home, then you must understand the different options that you have. Here is a look at some of them, based on which you may make a choice.</p><p><strong>The Slim U-shaped Kitchen:</strong> This is the perfect <strong>modular kitchen</strong> for a small home. The layout offers you the best possible space to maneuver within the facing aisles. You will find that the sink is placed below the one window you may have in your kitchen. The appliances will usually be placed on a facing leg. If you do not have a window, you may interchange the placement of your appliances and elements of the work triangle to suit your needs. You may even consider bringing in a peninsula on one leg to give you additional space.</p><p><strong>The Medium Sized U-Shaped Kitchen:</strong> This is a size of kitchen that usually accommodates two cooks with ease. The U-shape ends with two short tails, which you may use as per your convenience. This is a kitchen that can be placed within an alcove or have an open design which is perfect for homes with no designated boundaries for rooms. You may work around the storage spaces creating shelves and cupboards to suit specific needs. This is a kitchen that takes full height cabinets as well.</p><p><strong>The Large U-Shaped Kitchen:</strong> The larger U-shaped kitchen is ideally placed in big farmhouses or in homes that cater to large joint families. The space between the legs is wide, ensuring you can accommodate a few cooks in the kitchen at one time. It also makes way for the incorporation of an island, which will give you additional working or storage space.</p><p><strong>The Uneven U-Shaped Kitchen:</strong> Based on the contours of your <strong>kitchen interiors</strong>, there are U-shaped modular kitchens that may be altered to suit a space. This means that you may change the shape of the U to include a steeper incline on one side or a shorter length on the other. You may also change the placement of the work triangle based on the shape of the kitchen that you have settled for.</p><p>The U-shaped kitchen is a versatile option among modular kitchens.

  "blog_content": "<p><strong>Expert Speak:</strong> The standard <strong>U-shaped kitchen design</strong> may be manipulated in multiple ways to accommodate your specific tastes in set up and aesthetics.</p><p>If you are looking for a wonderfully functional kitchen that conforms to any space that you place it in, the U-shaped kitchen is your answer. It ideally fits in the work triangle, ensuring that your refrigerator, sink and cook stove are all within arm\\u2019s reach. All you have to do is pivot around to reach a section you are looking for. Here are some interesting layouts you can consider for your U-shaped kitchen:</p><p><strong>The Ideal Work Triangle:</strong> If you are looking for an efficient cooking space for your family, then create a <strong>U-shaped modular kitchen</strong> with the perfect work triangle. This is something that may be worked out even in a tight working space. Work with your designer to ensure that your bench top for prepping, the sink, and stove are at an ideal distance from each other. You may choose to include your fridge within the U or place it on an adjacent wall to get more maneuvering space.</p><p><strong>Go Glass:</strong> One of the ways to enhance the conventional U-shaped kitchen, irrespective of its size, is to work on the cabinetry. A standard U-shaped kitchen gives you overhead cabinets as well as those below. While solid door cupboards work ideally for those below, you may want to consider glass doors for the overhead cabinets. This gives your kitchen a beautiful look which may be further enhanced with in-cabinet lighting. Add in some alcove lighting for your counter tops and you will have an amazing kitchen to come home to everyday.</p><p><strong>Centralized Work Area: </strong>If you are working with a large kitchen space, you may want to consider playing around with the work area. You do not have to restrict it to only the legs of the U. How about bringing in a work island that can be utilized to prep as well as clean. Alternately you may use it to prep and to accommodate your family when dining. Such a layout adds immense character to your kitchen space.</p><p><strong>Placement of Appliances: </strong>One way in which to change the look of your <strong>U-shaped kitchen design</strong> from the standard set up is to have all your appliances placed on a single side of the kitchen. This allows you a lot of free space that you may use in any way that you would like to. You may also customize your storage space in this part of the kitchen to accommodate the accessories for each of your appliances.</p><p>These are just some of the ways in which you can work the look of your U-shaped kitchen. After all there is nothing like customizing your kitchen to your personal likes.</p>  ",

All you need to do is understand its pros and cons to make the right choice. </p><p>If there is one thing that innovation has given us, it is a lot of choice. While it may seem wonderful to have a great deal of choice in all that we need to do, often narrowing down on what is the ideal option is difficult. One of the dilemmas that faces you when you are working on shelving options for your <b>kitchen designs </b>is the choice of going with open or closed shelves. This question requires a fair bit of contemplation. Here are some pointers that may help you with the decision-making. </p><p><b>The Benefits of Open Shelves</b></p><ul><li ><p>Open shelves gives you the benefit of a casual feel for your kitchen.

Many times we remain comfortable with the thought of knowing what lies under what in a crowded drawer. But there will be days when you will roll up your sleeves and get down to de-cluttering your <strong>sleek kitchen</strong> and making it a much more accessible space.</p><p><img src=\"//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1054/3918/files/ORIOLE-Straight-Kitchen.jpeg?17378673363455642029\" alt=\"\"></p><p>So how does one go about de-cluttering kitchen storage space? For starters, you need to get down to the task at hand with a change in attitude. Most of us tend to be packrats, storing everything we get, from takeaway packaging to fancy looking plastic bottles and the like. You need to make up your mind to evaluate every item that you have and decide whether it is truly of use or not. This is the best way to get rid of all that you do not need.</p><p>To prepare for de-cluttering, you need to first clear up a working area where you can dump everything out of a drawer or cabinet. Also keep handy a few trash bags. You can use these to discard things, or segregate things to stow away later. Also keep a few boxes handy. These can be used to box up all that you do not use on a regular basis or to collect things that you want to give away.</p><p>Start from the cabinets on top and work your way down. For each item that you pick, as yourself a few questions to evaluate its necessity</p><ul><li><p>Is it in good condition?</p></li><li><p>Do I use it often?</p></li><li><p>Do I have too many of the same thing?</p></li><li><p>Can this be stored outside of the kitchen?</p></li><li><p>Can I place this in a particular category of items to store away?</p></li></ul><p>These questions will help you decide whether to keep an item or discard it or perhaps give it away. Once you are done sorting a cabinet or a shelf, clean the space out thoroughly, replace old newspapers that you may put down and then begin to keep things back. At this point, if you can place things in order of importance and utility, you will have a more functional kitchen.</p><p>Keep in mind that cleaning out kitchen cabinets and drawers can be a long and dreary task. Don\\u2019t aim to finish all in one day. Space out your cleaning and this will help you see things more clearly when evaluating them.</p><p>Once your <strong>modular kitchen</strong> is sorted, make sure that you do your best not to start accumulating things again. Stick to the categories you have make and ensure that each item goes back to its designated place.</p>  ",

The hygiene of your platform essentially dictates the quality of food that comes out of your kitchen. Here are a few ways that you can go about maintaining your platform.</p><p><strong>Prevent Stagnation:</strong> It is a given that you will be wiping down your kitchen platform each day. While doing this make sure that you do not have any small puddles of water stagnating around your platform. This can come from leaky bottles, a dented vessel or even a damp cloth that has been thrown on the platform.</p><p><strong>Wipe Before Use:</strong> Make sure to use a mild sanitizer to wipe down your platform before you use it to cut vegetables. This will get rid of any germs that may be on the surface of your platform.</p><p><strong>Let Your Platform Smell Good:</strong> There are quite a few simple home remedies that you can create to make your platform smell great. Squeeze in a few drops of lemon juice in warm water and wipe down your platform with it. This not only sanitizes, but also leaves a pleasant fragrance. You can try the same with some rose water as well. Keeping your platform free from roaches and insects is best done with citronella oil. This is a natural oil with a lemon base and a grassy finish. Wiping down your platform with this will keep it bug-free.</p><p><strong>Stain Removal:</strong> Many times, your platform is at the receiving end of spills and more. Dip a cloth in a small bit of vinegar and go over these stains. They will be removed in an instant thanks to acidic nature of the vinegar. Hot water and liquid detergents are your best options when it comes to regularly cleaning platforms.</p><p><strong>Modular kitchen designs</strong> are created in such a way so that there is ample working space on platforms. Maintaining this is essential to getting the most out of your cooking space.</p>  ",

It also ensures that your family is not in contact with harmful chemicals. </p><p>You have got yourself the <b>modular kitchen</b> that you have been dreaming of. You are now keen on doing your best to keep it clean not only on the surface level, but on a micro level as well. Of course the market is flooded with a range of chemical-based products that you may use to clean your kitchen. However, this is a space that you utilize to cook for your family. The slightest cross-contamination from these chemicals can have disastrous results on the health of your family. </p><p>Here are some eco-friendly cleaning solutions that you can easily make at home and use in your kitchen. Not only are they effective, but they have absolutely no negative effects on the health of your family. </p><p><b>Kitchen Sinks: </b>The sink is often a dumping ground for leftover food, spills, and even when you clean the platform and squeeze out the cloth. The chances of bacterial growth here are high, as is the presence of mold and germs. An effective cleaner may be made out of lemon juice or diluted vinegar (1:2). Soak your sink in this mixture for half an hour and then rinse clean. The acidity levels of the juice or the vinegar effectively kill all bacteria and germs. If you have a steel sink, you can scrub it down with some baking soda and salt and then rinse off. </p><p><b>Unclogging Drains:</b> Boil 4 liters of water along with half a cup of salt. Most clogs clear out with this mix. If you find that you are dealing with something stubborn, first pour down half a cup of baking soda and follow that up with half a cup of vinegar. You will find the rim of your drain fizzing for a while. Once this stops, wash down the solution with boiling water. This process is ideal for metal plumbing systems. </p><p><b>Cleaning Appliances:</b> You can use a damp sponge dipped in baking soda to scour the inside of your oven, microwave and your stove top to get them to sparkle clean. For really stubborn stains, make a paste of baking soda with water and apply it thoroughly to the inside of your oven or microwave. Let it be for 3 hours before you wipe it down with a wet cloth. </p><p><b>Cleaning Kitchen Cabinets:</b> All the shelves and surfaces of your <b>kitchen cabinets</b> may easily be cleaned with a mixture of vinegar and warm water (1:3). This will kill any bacteria and will ensure that oily grime, if any, is thoroughly removed. You may even add in a drop or two of essential oils for that sweet, lingering smell. </p><p><strong>Each of these home-made solutions will take a little extra effort in preparation and usage, but the end-result is a sparkling clean <b>kitchen interiors</b>, at the fraction of a cost. More importantly, it is the healthiest option for your family.</strong></p>  ",

Rusting metal, chipping wood and weak plastic can prove harmful in more ways than one. Choose your materials wisely.</p><p><strong>Appropriate Size</strong>: It is important that you choose the right size of <strong>study table</strong> and chair for your child to sit at and grow into as well. The area of the table should be large enough to hold 2-3 open books simultaneously and give a child enough of space to maneuver around. Too large or too small can be uncomfortable for a child.

You could choose from a range of your child\\u2019s favorite shades. You could also introduce art work or decals of your child\\u2019s favorite fictional characters.

You can choose to have tables and chairs that are fixed into a single unit. You could also opt for those that have bookshelves incorporated into them. Flexible elements in terms of table heights, removable shelves and other storage options can also be considered.

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Dr. Seuss, the famous children’s author, known for his witty lines and especially, for the wonderful artwork that accompanies each story. Did you know that he drew animal caricatures on the wall of his childhood home, encouraged by his mother? While many consider the common habit of a child “scribbling” a nuisance and something to be discouraged, it is actually a normal and healthy part of their development.</p><p>Just because a toddler or young child draws on the wall does not mean he or she is behaving badly or acting up. Maybe you furnished the child with paper and crayons, but came back to find a two-year-old’s artwork all over the wall. For young children whose fine motor skills are starting to develop, the coordination required to draw on a piece of paper is much more than the gigantic blank canvas that a wall offers. Have you ever noticed that drawing is not a simple hand and eyes function for a young child? Young ones draw with their entire selves – their bodies, their minds – all actively engaged as they come up with their art and try to put down what they are thinking or feeling. So, the larger the canvas, the more the child has to work with, right? And you never know, this early encouragement might be just what is needed for a child to foster a lifelong love of art or drawing, or indeed, even make a career out of it. </p><p><b>Fostering a Skill</b></p><p>So, while you don’t want your child decorating all the walls of your home or getting out of control with the crayons, there is something to be said for encouraging this artistic display. One way to keep it controlled and yet give the child his or her freedom of expression, is by assigning an art wall in the child’s room, where they can paint or colour to their heart’s content, and feel satisfied and not scared for having done so. Or, if you cannot spare the entire wall, then put up a giant black or white board at a height the child can make the most of, and give him/her free rein! Where you may see a smudge or lines of gibberish or splotches of colour on your wall, the child will see and love his or her attempts at expression – and if you ask, will probably even explain what each squiggle and dash signifies!</p><p>With older kids, what is the point in keeping this up, one might wonder. As children get older, with the burden of schoolwork and the distractions of technology and socializing, they spend less time on pursuits like drawing, unless it is a passion with them. Having a wall that is exclusively theirs to show off any artwork they create, or where they can jot down ideas or begin to flesh out ideas or thoughts they have (including putting into form a nightmare or bad dream, an idea for a project, or just about anything they may not be ready or able to articulate and therefore discuss yet), will be a good way to foster creativity, nurture ideas, and give children a sense of self. They will also feel a sense of pride and ownership of “my wall”.</p><p><b>Take-aways for Parents</b></p><p>For the parent too, there are things to be learned from watching the way the child creates his artwork. You will see patterns in the way the child associates with different subjects, how he or she ideates, and get an overall glimpse into how the child’s mind works, which will be very helpful when you’re helping the child with homework and assignments (is your child a visual learner, does he or she rely on words more, etc.).</p><p>Through and in children’s art, often lies the answers to what makes them happy, sad, fearful, and more, Art as therapy is in widespread use amongst psychologists, special education teachers, and counsellors. Having an art wall at home, in his or her own space, means that a child can express himself or herself whenever the mood strikes, and may share information and clues as to their state of mind and well-being, it is up to the parent to keep a watch out for them.</p><p>Plus, once you’ve given the child a defined space, you will find that he or she won’t be scribbling on all the walls or on the floor or furniture. If you assign a particular space, give the child ownership, and discuss which materials are okay (crayons, paints, stickers) and which are not (a lipstick or nail polish, a fancy pen), you are teaching the child boundaries and also ensuring learning. Thus, the reasons to give up one of the walls to your child are manifold, and the psychological, physiological and long-term benefits are many.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>For the frequent traveller, there may be the constant feel of living out of a suitcase – pack/unpack; rinse/repeat, and high levels of travel fatigue. Taking a few essentials from home that help you feel connected/calmer/more in tune, is one way to achieve this – so, let’s take a look at some comforts of home that can make travelling happier.</p><ul><li><b>Cloaking your feet: </b>Having your favoured pair of flip-flops, the warm fuzzy slippers you plunge your feet into first thing in the morning, or that pair of socks you pull on after a hard day at work, are an easy way to enjoy a simple home comfort. It will help you relax and feel more at home in your unfamiliar surroundings, not to mention your feet will thank you for the sensory memory and comfort! So, consider the foot gear of your choice as one of those essentials you shouldn’t leave home without, and make sure it’s packed for your next trip.</li><li><b>Foodie Rituals: </b>Some people just cannot begin the day without a cuppa – be it a strong cup of coffee or a tea of choice. While this tea/coffee morning ritual is almost done on autopilot when you are in your own home, come travel time it can get a tad challenging. Sure, many hotels, and of course all of the nicer ones, provide basic equipment and provisions for making a cup of coffee or tea in the room. However, it is generic instant coffee and black tea in many places, along with a non-dairy creamer or powder. If you have an addiction to a particular flavour set – say Earl Grey tea or Green Tea or a soothing herbal concoction, or a vanilla creamer or specific coffee brand, then packing some bags of your brew of choice is definitely a home essential you must not do without. Comfort foods and snacks too, are a part of this essential foodie kit, if you are travelling abroad or to a place without easy access to a grocery store. And should you get hungry at midnight or on the flight, you’ll have something to munch on at arm’s reach, no need for room service or in-flight food!</li><li><b>Electronic Essentials: </b>Tying into the need for the perfect cup of tea or coffee in the morning, what if you’re going someplace that does not offer an electric kettle in the room? Well, you’ll just have to carry your own, then! There are good options in the travel sized category that will not take up too much space in your suitcase. For others, having an iron box on hand could be the most essential electronic from home – again, there are foldable ones that make carrying them a synch! Another must-have for some people could be a reading light that affords you the brightness and clarity you need to read your book before hitting the bed, or indeed, on board a train or plane or bus where the ambient light often doesn’t do enough for someone wanting to read.</li><li><b>Wrap Time: </b>Hotel sheets and pillows are mostly white, with heavily overstuffed or else hard pillows and mattresses that have no ability to mould to your body or head, given that they play host to so many different shaped and sized people on a regular basis. For some, having the right pillow or blanket can make all the difference between a good or bad night’s sleep. If you do not already have a travel pillow or cover up (blanket, scarf or stole, fleece throw) that is your best friend at night, and it means you have difficulty sleeping when travelling, time to remedy that! Choose a pillow that is compact in size and meets the firmness specifications you have, and find yourself a cover that can do double duty on board the flight/train/bus/car, as well as at night. And there are some folk who just hate the idea of using mass towels, and who much prefer to carry their own so they feel comfortable and clean after their shower.</li><li><b>Your Favourite Toiletries: </b>Not one for the generic, often unheard of shampoo, shower-gel, 2-in-1, mini soap toiletries that most hotels favour? Enjoy having your familiar brand and its invigorating or soothing scent envelop you in the shower? Then, carrying travel-sized bottles of your own shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion are essential to your well-being and happiness – and if they don’t come in mini sized packaging, buy plastic bottles and pour them in yourself! </li></ul><p>These are some small and simple ways you don’t have to leave the comforts of home behind, even when you’re away from home. All these items speak to making yourself comfortable and feeling more secure and calm in unfamiliar or sterile hotel rooms. And when it’s such an easy fix, why should you go without your home essentials?</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Your home is your personal castle, your haven, your safe space, the place you’ve spent countless hours to make just perfect. It’s a reflection of your personality, your creativity, your aesthetic vibe. Home is where the heart is, and we will always make and have our most precious moments and mementoes in our homes.</p><p>Let’s talk today about what some of those precious things might be – for while the memories will be yours forever, what would you reach for first, if you could only pick a handful of things from your home? What are those precious, irreplaceable and can’t-do- without items for you that you’d just have to take with you? Would it be items that represent the past or the present? Would they be family heirlooms, items collected painstakingly over years, mementoes of places you’ve been, or gifts from special people? And to a young child, it would be the “blankey” or stuffed toy of childhood. And to the pet owner, surely it would be their cat/dog/bird/guinea pig.</p><p><b>Photographic Proof: </b>In today’s world, everyone has a phone and takes pictures galore. And many tend to have them backed up to the Cloud too. So perhaps your photographic memory box is safely accessible online, or maybe just a small hard drive holds those photographic GBs. But what about images of times gone by, when digital cameras and phones were not even on the horizon? Photographs of family elders, even one’s own childhood for that matter, are all generally tucked away in those big bound albums – we all have a collection somewhere, that only comes out when one is in a mood to relive memories, or a long lost friend or relative or face from the past comes to mind or meets us. And amongst those big books of pictures, each of us would have a couple that would be most dear – an album chronicling the birth and childhood years of our kids, that wedding album, trip abroad, the college years…</p><p><b>Collection of Collectibles: </b>Are you someone who has spent many years and many pennies on a particular collection, picking them up on travels, at flea markets, requesting friends and family who travel abroad to snag you the item for your collection, or maybe even growing a collection that was handed down to you by an older sibling, parent, or grandparent? Be it paintings or sculptures, old coins, stamps, glass figures, Fabergé eggs, model cars, etc., the list is endless and your attachment to your collection will make it be one of those things you reach for, as very precious objects you must have from your home. For the film buff, it could involve a collection of DVDs, while the music lover might have an enviable selection of CDs, tapes, and perhaps even the odd LP or three lying around that they wouldn’t dream of leaving behind.</p><p>Maybe it’s something that would have no meaning or value for anyone other than yourself – peacocks or flamingos of all shapes and sizes and materials that speak to your love of that particular bird – but where each of them has a special story, and is meaningful and precious for you. Or maybe, you’re someone with an enviable collection of handbags, or shoes? Surely you’d want those with you then!</p><p>Or, maybe it’s a collection of spices or sauces from all over, or the rare whiskeys or tequilas from far flung collections that you’ve built up… at the end of the day, your memories and your investment, fiscally and emotionally, are what will define the worth of an item or collection, and deem it worthy of a spot on your “precious four” list.</p><p><b>Books & Musical Instruments: </b>There are those for whom there is no substitute for a good book. These are folks who can get lost in a good book and who will have specific memories tied to different books, and will reread them every now and then. For such a soul, their books, or maybe certain books, will be precious.</p><p>Similarly, for a musician, for whom the instrument they play is akin to a friend and long term companion rather than just a vessel that produces pretty sounds, it would be quite unimaginable to not have their instrument, be it a tabla, violin, guitar, flute, saxophone or drums, on their most precious list. A singer might gather up all the sheet music and books filled with musical notes and compositions.</p><p><b>Tools of the trade: </b> A carpenter would not leave his home without his tools, nor would a painter leave his precious palette or brushes behind. If you’re a chef or baker, then your measuring cups and knives might become what define you and not having them would leave you incomplete. For a techie, his most precious possession might well be his array of digital devices!</p><p>Whether a hobby, vocation, career, craft, or just a repository of love, memories and misty eyed thoughts, each of us will have our precious four that are a reflection of our selves, and our souls – there are likely a whole host more than what we’ve thought of here!</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Sure a studio apartment is small, but that doesn’t mean it has to be cramped. There are many ways to make a studio apartment look spacious while allowing it to be aesthetic and useful too. We tell you how.</p><p>They might not have space for stunning hallways, grand sweeping staircases, opulent bedrooms and the like but, studio apartments can definitely make up for the shortfall with panache. Just big enough to swing a bat, these one-room apartments can be aesthetically designed and fulfill your hopes for a dream home.</p><p>You can have it all in a little space. Ivory painted walls and simple lines make the room look light and airy, but sometimes one can break the rules and paint walls with bright colors to create a magnificent effect. Also one can make proper use of unconventional storage space and embedded multi-purpose furniture. Here are some tricks that we have for you.</p><ul><li>Use a uniform color palette as this will not make space look too congested.</li><li>Keep accessories minimal. Indoor plants can add depth to the space. </li><li>Large mirrors can emphasize on the openness and spaciousness of the room, thus making one feel more connected. Otherwise, add a mirror covered closet to make the room appear big.</li><li>Use a bookcase as a room divider, especially if you hate the idea of looking at your bed all the time. Alternately, you can put your bed in a corner and the bookcase at the foot of the bed. This will give enough room for the living area, thus creating an illusion of space.</li><li>A console table placed behind the sofa can define the changeover between the living room and kitchen. The console can be used for storing kitchen items and countertop space for placing decorative items. A series of shallow shelves around the television, for instance, can add more storage space in what would usually be considered a dead space.</li><li>You don't always have to start with a sofa. A daybed can provide more flexibility in terms of decoration. It can be flipped down in the night and transformed into a cozy bedroom. If a sofa isn't working in your space, try placing two chairs.</li><li>Less space does not mean that all the furniture has to stick to the walls. The room can look more spacious by using floating furniture or wall shelves. Nesting tables can be utilized as extra side tables that may be used in many ways.</li><li>Add color into space with wallpaper or an accent wall. When sleeping and living areas merge as one, use paint, wallpaper, and color to designate distinct areas.</li><li>Arrange artwork in tight clusters rather than spreading throughout the space. It will give the impression of a gallery wall and will draw the eye to a particular spot. Consider hanging scarves, belts, sunglasses, or jewelry on the walls.</li><li>Fixing a small chandelier above the bed can keep the room from feeling claustrophobic.</li><li>There is furniture that works double-duty. The dining table, for instance, doubles as a kitchen island when there is a lot of cooking and also as a work table.</li></ul><p><b>Planning a maintenance schedule: </b>A studio apartment does not attract much maintenance cost. Keeping the place cool in summer and warm in winter is going to consume less energy. Therefore, these energy efficient homes will ensure lower rents and electricity bills. Once a year, get AC / kitchen chimney inspection done; check and fix window damages. Every one or two months, change air filters and clean fridge. This ensures that you have an energy efficient space as well.</p><p>You can never be sure how space will expand into something bigger, so there is no reason to wait for your dream home. So, how do you want your studio apartment to be like?</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Comfort and convenience define sleeper sofas these days. They are not only easy on the eyes but, easy on the back too. They double up as seating arrangements and when you have guests to accommodate, open out into comfortable beds as well.</p><p>Say bye to that saggy mattress that you take out when guests come home. The latest sofa beds are not only easy on the eyes but, on the back too. Inexpensive? Not really! Classy and comfortable? You bet. Multi-purpose sleeper sofas can provide additional sleeping space in your living room if you do not have enough beds to accommodate your guests.</p><p>How does it work? During the day it is a comfortable couch, perfect for reading or watching television. When guests have to be accommodated, the cushions can come off, and the sofa be transformed into a place for sleeping. These comfortable, convertible futons are much better than an air mattress that is usually the norm when guests come visiting. Stylish and useful at the same time, it best for an apartment, even one that is short on space.</p><p><b>A Range of Styles to Choose From </b>Designers can be credited with coming up with umpteen designs for sleeper sofas. Tuxedo-style sofa beds suit both modern and classic tastes; leather sleeper sofas are apt for bachelor pads; traditional style lounge seats with convertible sleeping options are best for studio apartments; and love seats that convert into a twin bed are perfect for 'tight-on-space' apartments.</p><p>For the apartments that are really small, the square form, low back and compact silhouette in neutral colors works really well. For twin sleeping arrangements, the sofa with the three position angled arms works ideally. These handles may be lowered to create a twin-size sleeping space.</p><p>Also look into the colors of sofas that you can invest in, especially since it has to complement your decor. If you have sleeper sofas in neutral shades, lend a classic touch to your room by throwing on some vibrant pillows. This adds color to your space. For contemporary monotone or dual tone interiors, add in a touch of color with some soothing blue. Something like a soft denim enzyme washed many times is perfect for your space. If a more traditional look is what you are aiming for, brass base sofa beds with button tufting and tuxedo arms combined with traditional and modern motifs can add luxury to your living space.</p><p><b>What to Keep in Mind When Buying a Sleeper Sofa.</b></p><ul><li><b>Select the right size: </b> Parent’s love to go all the way when it comes to decorating their children’s rooms. More often than not, the inherent danger that some accessories pose to children is not always clear to adults. Here are a few things to keep in mind.</li><li><b>Choose the right mattress: </b> Spring mattresses can make creaky spring sounds while rolling over, whereas sleeper sofas come with foam options and innerspring /air hybrids (air is inflated above the traditional spring mattress to make it look thicker). Make sure to test it before buying it.</li><li><b>Opt for foam tops: </b> Nowadays, sleeper sofa bed comes with a padding added to the top, making it comfy to sleep on. Opt for this if you prefer.</li><li><b>Check Mechanisms: </b> Make sure there are no sharp points that can tear your sheets. The mechanism should be smooth when you are pulling and putting back the mattress. </li><li><b>Be Weight-Conscious: </b> The product can be quite heavy since sleeper sofas are basically beds inside a couch. Try an inflatable mattress, if you have to haul your mattress several flights of stairs to install it.</li><li><b>Select the Appropriate Frame: </b> Avoid metal frames as it can dig into your guests. A kiln-dried hardwood frame is best as it keeps moisture from the wood at bay and therefore, there is no cracking. This works especially well for humid cities.</li><li><b>Consider Comfy Cushions: </b> Since you would be spending a lot of time sitting on the sofa, make sure the cushions are comfortable and of good quality. They come in various upholstery like leather, polyester, cotton, silk, microfiber, etc. The upholstery fabric can be plain or printed. To keep it dust and dirt free, go for a material that you can easily clean with a damp cloth.</li></ul><p>Tiny, multi-purpose and stylish - sofa beds not only save space but can be the perfect space saving solution.

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Children’s rooms can often be a space where young ones can sustain injuries from simple things that may have easily been avoided. Here is how you can ensure that your children have a safe space to play and sleep in.</p><p>Your children are your world. You will want to give them the best, while teaching them the value of hard work and accountability. In order to set a good base for them, you will want to give them rooms to call their own. These rooms will be a reflection of their personalities as they grow and explore the world. These are also spaces that they will be spending a lot of time in as well. Teaching children independence begins with them functioning out of their rooms. You will want to make sure that this is a safe place for them.</p><p>Children will be children and especially from the toddler stage on, you will have a set of curious eyes exploring rooms and testing things out. Here are some tips on how you can ensure that your children are safe in their rooms, even if you are not always around to supervise them.</p><p><b>Furniture: </b>Children of most ages are prone to bumping into things. You can ensure that they are not hurt too badly. The edges of beds and tables can be lined with soft bumpers that may be customized to the piece of furniture they are being used on. This means that even if children bang into a table, they will not sustain any dangerous wounds.</p><p>For chairs, try and invest in chairs made of plywood or plastic or even particle boards and MDF. These are lightweight materials which means that if your child pulls these chairs down, they will not get hurt. On the other hand, such chairs also provide a sturdy seating option for when they are at their study tables. Considering that children will grow, these chairs will serve their purpose well for a long time.</p><p>Ideally ensure that tables have open shelves for storage. There are chances of little fingers getting caught in drawers, especially when you have siblings sharing a room. Alternately, you can have child-proofing done to your drawers which ensure that little ones can’t pull them out or get their fingers caught in it. </p><p><b>Accessories: </b>Parent’s love to go all the way when it comes to decorating their children’s rooms. More often than not, the inherent danger that some accessories pose to children is not always clear to adults. Here are a few things to keep in mind.</p><p>If you are having a TV in your child’s room, ideally wall mount it. This way it cannot be pulled down. Ensure you have very strong wall mounted curtain rods that can take little tykes dangling on them. You may also want to have shorter curtains to avoid little ones getting tangled in them. Skip having table mounted lamps on bedside tables. Wall mount them instead. This will help when that stray ball comes flying into the room.</p><p><b>Doors and windows: </b>Always ensure you have door and window stoppers in place. Whether they are playing and want to bang something in anger like children are wont to do, these can ensure their safety. You will want to have these stoppers on the front and back of the door. This way when enthusiastic kids burst through their rooms, your walls and the paint will not take a beating.</p><p>Have windows that open outwards rather than in. It’s very easy for a child to miss seeing an open window and walking right into it. When it comes to the grills of the window, make sure that they are designed such that curious kids cannot get their limbs stuck in them.</p><p><b>Bathroom: </b>The bathroom is one place where boisterous children can end up hurting themselves. Start with the basics, ensure that tub and the sink have no sharp or hard corners. If you have stools for the little ones to stand on when brushing their teeth, ensure that these have anti-slip grips. It is also a good idea to install anti-slip tiles outside the bathing area and in it as well. This way bath time need not end up in tears because of a bath. If you are installing shower curtains, make sure that these are on sturdy rods that cannot be pulled down.</p><p>These are the main ways in which you can do up your children’s room in an aesthetic, yet safe manner. As your children grow into responsible human beings, they will have a space that they will love and feel completely at ease in.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Celebrity endorsements can reap huge rewards for a brand. But there can be many pitfalls that consumers should also be aware of before buying a product.</p><p>There is an elite party going on and female fans have surrounded Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan. While greeting them, he realizes he has a lipstick mark on his face. Shah Rukh enters the bathroom to clean himself when he is mesmerized by the stunning bathing brand. He returns to the party but is always making an attempt to get back to the bathroom. Did this advertisement work for the company?</p><p>Last year, Shah Rukh Khan was signed by a luxury bathing brand as its ambassador. Bathrooms are now Wi-Fi driven corners that homeowners love to flaunt. The question is, did it increase the sales of this five-decade-old brand? The experts beg to differ.</p><p>It is believed that popular faces have always been excellent salespersons. Presenting to the world a known face is the best and the quickest way for companies to create their brand in the minds of its consumers. When a famous actor or a sports personality becomes a part of a product or a brand, it immediately gains credibility. The use of celebrities is not a new concept. It dates back to the 1800s when Queens endorsed medicines. The methods might have changed now, but the concept remains the same.</p><p>There are many advantages of hiring celebrities to endorse your product. If you have positive views about a celebrity, it makes the brand or product more attractive. </p><p><b>Influencing consumers buying decision: </b>The attraction that people have towards certain celebrities can influence their buying decision and give a huge sale boost to the product. It is the best way to target a group. Perhaps even attract new customers who could be the fans' of celebrities.  Some believe that 'if a star is endorsing this product, then it must be exquisite.' If a celebrity-turned-designer runs an interior company, then it is even better.</p><p>For instance, the quintessential Bollywood star kid Twinkle Khanna might not have set the things on fire, but she is a successful interior designer today. Her company, 'White Window' deals in home decor, apparel and designer candles. When Gauri Khan, the star-wife with a penchant for interiors, designed her house Mannat, it got great reviews because of her husband's popularity and secondly because of her work - opulent dining room, Shakespearean balconies transporting into the world of romance, etc. When she launched her design store 'Design Cell', it was supported by her husband Shah Rukh Khan, and director Karan Johar tweeted saying that it is by far one of the best interior stores he has ever been too. Since then it has been an upward graph for her.</p><p><b>Giving a new life to a failing brand: </b>A celebrity can give a new lease of life to a dying brand. It can create new interest and excitement in their customers too. For instance, when style diva Sonam Kapoor says, 'I would like to show you my most prized possession,' does it generate interest in the consumers? Did it help the company that was running in a loss? Well, the brand's share increased from 19 per cent to 23 per cent.</p><p><b>But can celebrity endorsements always sell products? </b>It is a common belief often passed down by people that hiring a celebrity for your product is the fastest way to get maximum coverage. But keep your wallet aside and it can prove to be a myth. Blinded by the celebrity status can make one fail to see the product if it is not good and probably 'desperate.'</p><p>Let us assume that you have launched a new set of furniture for home or office. Do we need a celebrity to endorse it? Is there a connection between the star and the furniture. Since it is a part of interiors, one would target interior journalists who recommend interviews with your celebrity and photographs of your product. But in reality, how much publicity is your furniture going to get? How much can a celebrity speak about your furniture? You might get a photograph published but are people going to buy your furniture because there is a celebrity with it?</p><p>The best example of celebrity run interior business going kaput is that of tennis star Venus Williams. She calls herself as a 'certified interior decorator' who started her Florida-based firm, 'V Starr' in 2002. It ran into trouble with regards to licensing laws as it was operating for a year without a permit. But who would hire a tennis star to decorate their home or business?</p><p>Celebrity endorsements undoubtedly play a pivotal role in promoting a product, but it is not the answer to all the problems that 'some experts' might believe. There are both positive and negative aspects of celebrity endorsements, deeply ingrained in consumer psychology and behavior.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>We go to restaurants to feed our stomachs and socialize, yes. But when the setting is pretty as a picture and you find yourself marveling at your surroundings, and maybe even getting distracted from the menu, well that’s a whole different dining experience! We’ve picked our top five restaurants in Bangalore that give us the “feels” when it comes to architecture and design.</p><p><b>Smoke House Deli: </b>Glass exteriors, predominantly white interiors with line drawings in black and touches of red, that are customized to the location (in this case, Bangalore) and tell a tale of the city, from its roots to contemporary figures, this is one place where you won’t be able to resist getting up from your seat and wandering around, trying to figure out the various references on the walls. From the Raghu Dixit Project to Lal Bagh, and even a reference to Thindi Beedhi, aka V.V. Puram’s Food Street, you will find plenty to muse over as you await your meal. The bar is a solid and inviting expanse with more drawings, from behind which the bartenders create their concoctions. Intricate carved lighting fixtures, and a very old school saloon style double door leading to the restrooms are other little unusual notes. The seating, which comprises a few outdoor lawn furniture table and chair placements, as well as booths and more tables inside, is conducive to both, large family gatherings or groups of friends, as well as more intimate dining. And with the walls being so entertaining even to adults, you can be sure the kids will be kept busy exploring! </p><p><b>153 Biere Street: </b>Ever wished you could escape the city and find yourself wandering in a European setting, cobbled streets, wrought iron street lamps, park benches, window boxes with colorful flowers and all? Well, that’s the vibe that 153 Biere Street exudes. With a central courtyard, around which three restaurants and a few shops are laid out, and where pop up stores or a market will also appear on occasion, you will find yourself leaving your daily woes and any sense of being in a big city, far behind you. Colorful shopfronts on the ground floor, and the beautiful window boxes of flowers that you look up at when you gaze towards the first floor, add some color to the proceedings. The central courtyard has numerous black metal table and chair arrangements, as well as park benches. So, whether you want a break from your wanderings, or are in the mood for a sit down meal, you’ll find a comfortable nook. There is a space at one end for live performances or for kids to run around and play. </p><p><b>Sotally Tober: </b>A tongue twister name, and a décor and interiors to match. Gravity defying chairs, driftwood and mason jars and teapot lights, walls that have splashes and artistic splotches of paint (inspired by none other than artist Jackson Pollack), make for a visually interesting dining experience. Even if you’re not a smoker, take a walk over to the smoking zone, which has been set up with a toughened glass ceiling bordered with planters and more paint splattered tables and stools. The foyer is another place you’ll want to spend a few minutes, with its Holi colors in large glass jars, with the surrounding walls showcasing a range of collective manual cameras. The space is inviting and colorful and will make you lose yourself in its vibrancy.</p><p><b>The Open Box: </b>Faux greenery, real planters, a world map in faux grass, colorful cartoon and pop art, and a variety of seating arrangements in bright primary colors, or in black and white – you will find yourself looking around and then looking again at the many quirky elements that make Open Box a visual delight. Between the large screen at one end of the space, are two seating arrangements that boast big yellow armchairs – when in a small group or just a couple, this is the spot you want to snag. A quick game of pool is set up right there too! The space known as The Garage has flexible glass doors and is done up in black and white, with heavy link chain connecting the tables to the ceiling that they’re suspended from (they can be rolled up into the ceiling when you need more space – it is used as an exercise space in the mornings, now that’s multitasking!). You’ll feel like you’re in a garage, and this space has been envisaged for corporate gatherings and off-sites.</p><p><b>Nimisserie: </b>An expanse of glass, white interiors, inlay marble place settings, funky white chairs and tables, and a high ceiling all contribute to the feeling of opulence that embrace one as you walk into Nimisserie, a modern meets classic restaurant. With a cobblestone driveway and vertical garden to greet you, once you are inside the double doors you find yourself in an air conditioned glass wine cellar, a specially designed and imposing structure that has bottle holders that reach all the way to the lofty ceiling, and with all those mirrors, you’ll feel like you’re in a never ending wine collection! The open plan kitchen on the ground floor offers you a view of your meal-in-process, and culminates in the lounge seating space, which has an enormous white cherry tree (mock) on one side and the bar on the other.  Make sure to head upstairs to check out one of the three private dining areas – cordoned off by beaded curtains, with plush red seats and chandelier lighting – you will feel quite imperial in these nooks! </p><p>From innovative use of space, to art and hand drawn etchings on the walls, to quirky accents and largess of space or glass, glass everywhere, these are places where you’ll enjoy a feast for your eyes as well as your palate!</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>There are a few kitchen issues that seem to be perpetually annoying in most kitchens that are not designed well. Here is how you can address these issues with a customized modular kitchen design.</p><p>The kitchen is one of the busiest places in your home, after your living room. The family’s meals are made here, you entertain at times, and there is a lot of foot traffic with members and visitors going in and out. Overall, the kitchen can be a high maintenance place if you do not have your fundamentals in order. A customized modular kitchen will definitely address all of the issues you may have. For a better understanding, here are five common problems faced in a regular kitchen.</p><p><b>An Obstructed Work Flow: </b>Many homes, especially those that did not have their interiors designed by specialists, end up having a work flow that is disproportionate. You may have excessive platform space, but very little left for the actual cooking and cleaning. Or you may have an island, where you ideally should have had a peninsula and this can take away from the space that you have. The same goes with storage space. The most common of problems is not having the space needed to store larger vessels and gadgets. A well designed modular kitchen will address all these issues for you in an aesthetic manner, with the perfect work triangle put in place. </p><p><b>Insufficient Ventilation:</b>Based on the design of your home and the placement of rooms around it, many a times, kitchen remain poorly ventilated. It is great if you have a large window or a chimney over your hob to take the cooking smells, but you will still need some form of ventilation within your kitchen to ensure that smells do not permeate through the house. Considering how greasy Indian cooking can get, it is essential that the kitchen design you have in mind address proper ventilation needs. Whether you are remodeling your kitchen or having a new modular kitchen placed in, work with your designer towards this end. Kitchens will be fitted with ventilation systems that ensure a cross current takes odors out and brings fresh air in.</p><p><b>Inadequate Storage:</b>What often happens with the storage in any kitchen is that one aims to have pretty looking displays rather than those that are efficient. The end result is that several of your everyday needs will not have a place of their own and this will result in clutter on work counters, further cutting down working area. A modular kitchen addresses this by creating storage areas not only based on the average size of utensils and other kitchen gadgets that you have, but based on your usage of them. These may be placed overhead, below and in islands that may be a part of your kitchen. One of the many benefits of a designer kitchen is that you get to dictate the way you would like your space and the designer brings in the aesthetics. From open and closed shelves to bins, to roll out shelves and more, there are so many options that you can think of including.</p><p><b>Lack of Good Lighting:</b> It is usually quite hard to get the lighting grid of kitchen right. You may end up having a lot of light trained on your refrigerator, rather than on your work area. You may find that digging into the bins below your platform can be an effort in groping in the dark. Getting the right kind of lighting can be one of the biggest hassles of setting up your kitchen. Your designer will take into account the way you function in the kitchen, where your essentials are played and how best to innovate on bringing out the aesthetics of your kitchen. All this will reflect in the lighting grid of your kitchen.</p><p><b>Disconnect with the Décor of your Home:</b>One of the key concerns with most kitchens is that its design usually seems to be in a world of its own. There is a complete disconnect between the kitchen and the rest of the home. Especially with open kitchens that need to seamlessly flow from the living/dining area into the kitchen, chances of a disconnect are even higher. Modular kitchens are designed keeping the aesthetics of your home in perspective. This means that no matter how you look at your kitchen, it will not seem jarring or different when compared to the other rooms in your home.</p><p>These are some of the basic issues that most kitchens face. Dealt with professionally and with the right interaction from you, the user of the kitchen, you can have a space that is a beautiful as well as aesthetic. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b> Growing your own food is a concept that is catching on immensely. There are several simple ways to go about it. These 5 points will ensure that you are going in the right direction.</p><p>Almost every one of us has the soul of a farmer buried somewhere deep inside. On those few occasions that we see or read about home vegetable gardens that cater to the needs of a family, we feel the desire to start one up ourselves. Of course, this is a great initiative to undertake. Nothing like being self-sufficient as far as basic vegetable needs are concerned. Moreover you also have complete control over the quality of your produce.</p><p>If you are planning on creating a vegetable garden of your own, here are 5 major points you need to keep in mind.</p><p><b>Prepping your Space: </b>If you have a good outdoor space for your garden then all you need to do is ensure that the soil is of good quality and or is fortified to be so. If you would like to start a terrace or a balcony garden, then water-proofing will be your first concern. This is to help avoid stagnation of water around your pots. Pots can be placed equidistant from each other. If you have large and heavy pots its best to place them over the load bearing pillars of your home. If you are worried about the weight that your terrace or balcony has to carry you may want to consider plastic pots over terracotta and stone.</p><p>Also make sure that you keep a track of how much sunlight your proposed gardening area gets. This will help you decide on the kind of plants to be placed there.</p><p><b>Choosing Your Plants: </b>Novice gardeners are usually excited about starting something new and tend to pick up every conceivable kind of plant. This is not a good way to begin. Start by making a list of vegetables and greens that you consume on a regular basis and in good quantities. Begin with just these plants. Once you have got the hang of it, you can expand your garden to include other produce as well. Chillies, spinach, methi and tomatoes are top of the list usually and the seeds for these can be sourced from your own kitchen. </p><p><b>Working with Tight Spaces: </b>One of the usual concerns with home gardening of this nature is the lack of space. There are several interesting ways to address this. From suspended points to those placed on railings to racked placement of pots and even vertical gardens. You will even find gardening specialists who will create options based on your specific needs.</p><p><b>Plan your Watering Systems: </b>An over-enthusiastic gardener can end up over-watering his plants. You will know that a plant needs water when the pot begins to feel light and you see a gap between the soil and pot. Watering a plant should moisten the soil and not drain out excessively. Your watering schedule should also vary according to the season. It would be best if you can have rain water harvesting systems in place. </p><p><b>Avoid These Novice Mistakes: </b>There are a few things to keep in mind so that you have flourishing garden.</p><ul><li>Ensure that you organize your plants in places that get the right amount of sunlight.</li><li>Never overwater your plants</li><li>Begin with a few, harvest your first crop and then add on to what you have.</li><li>Composting, rain water harvesting, mulching are all concepts that are best implemented in an organic garden.</li></ul><p>So there you have it, 5 simple tips to keep in mind when beginning on your vegetable garden. Go on ahead – there is nothing like the farm to fork experience of your own making.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b> The beauty of Kashmir may be brought into your homes through simple additions comprising of the beautiful art forms of the region. Here are some ideas on how you can go about it.</p><p>Think Kashmir, and naturally the thoughts go straight to chilly weather, houseboats, Dal Lake, some great food and even more wonderful items of décor. Though Kashmir may be ravaged by militants, it still holds a special place among us all for a beauty that has always been evergreen. </p><p>Bringing in Kashmiri elements of décor into your home will ensure that yours will be an abode that is culturally inclined. It will carry an aura of serenity and delicate beauty. From the intricate weaves of its carpets and linen to the colourful looks exuded by its papier-mache artefacts, there are so many things you can do to bring a bit of Kashmir into your homes.</p><p>Here are a few tips to help you make a beginning. </p><p><b>Hand Carved Furniture: </b>An integral part of most Kashmiri homes is carved furniture. These can be tables, chair, dressing table, side tables and more. Kashmir is perhaps one of the few places in the world to have a culture of walnut wood carving. There are five styles of such carving known as Undercut or Khokerdhar, lattice work known as Jalidhar, deep carving or Vaboraveth. Semi and shallow carving are also forms of wood carving that you will want to include in the décor plan that you have for your Kashmiri styled home. </p><p><b>Papier Mache Curios: </b>Another element of décor that Kashmir is really famous for is that of papier-mache. A handicraft brought down by the Muslims of Persia, these highly decorative pieces of art are used as vases, cups, trays, lamp bases and much more. Over the years the art has evolved to match modern demands, which means that you see a lot of it being incorporated into wind chimes, jewellery boxes, curios and the like. Bringing these into your home will allow you to do up floating shelves, sideboards and even dressing tables with some interesting knick-knacks. </p><p><b>Kashmiri Carpets: </b>If there is one thing that people love to bring with them back from Kashmir, it is their carpets. Kashmiri rugs are made of pure wool, are hand-woven and come in a range of characteristic Kashmiri colours and patterns. There are a few occasions when silk is woven into the blend of the carpet as well. Most of the colour tones used are of gems stones. This allows you match carpets to the décor and colour scheme of your room. </p><p><b>Cushions with Aari Work: </b>Aari is a form of embroidery that uses silken threads and hook. Chain stitches are primarily used to create patterns. These are woven into cushions, blankets, runners and the like. You can invest in a set of soft furnishing that show off this particular kind of art work. It lends to the elegance of your home and gives you space the perfect Kashmiri ambiance that you are aiming for.</p><p><b>Bring in Some Kashmiri Silverware: </b>Known as Naqash, the Kashmiri silverware art form involves the engraving of items of everyday use such as samovars, vases, ashtrays, jewellery boxes and the like. The work done is intricate and comprises floral designs, calligraphy and geometric designs. Even if you do not use these items regularly in your home, they serve as wonderful artefacts to brighten up dull corners.</p><p>These are just some of the ways in which you can incorporate Kashmiri elements into your décor and bring in the elegant look and feel of this culture into your homes.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>It does not happen often but the chores in a household need to be equally distributed among all to maintain it and give the house a clear and fresh look. Here is a look at tasks men can routinely take. </p><p>Let’s face it, taking the larger picture into consideration, men do significantly lesser number of household chores than women. In fact studies have been conducted on ethnic groups across the world and the results remain unanimous, women tend to do much more of the household chores than men do. But, let us not undermine the section of men that actually lend in a helping hand. </p><p>There are several tasks a man can do that will help clean up a room as well as give it a brighter look. Let’s take a look at some of them.</p><p><b>Picking up after everyone’s done: </b>This is may seem like a small and insignificant task but it can go a long way in ensuring the clutter in a room is reduced to a large extent. From snack packets to books and magazines, personal technology, just about anything that needs to be put away can be done by the men of a home. Doing this on a regular basis will also ensure that it becomes a habit thus making the job much easier to handle on a regular basis. It also works towards ensuring that another task can be taken on just as easily. </p><p><b>Dusting and Vacuuming: </b>In India, particularly, most of our cleaning revolves around dusting our homes. Having dust settle down regularly in every nook and cranny can make things quite difficult to maintain. Handing over the dusting chores to men on a regular basis can get the job done. You can start with a room a day and keep the cycle going. Add to this the task of vacuuming carpets, the sides of sofas and even those dust-laden fans. Clearing a room of dust can instantly brighten the space up like no other. </p><p><b>Curtain and Linen Changing: </b>This can be quite a task when undertaken. From climbing up ladders to get those curtains down, to lifting mattresses to tuck that linen in. Handing the task over to men can make things a whole lot easier considering most of them don’t even need to get on a ladder to remove curtains. Assign this task to men. Have a reminder system in place along with your options for curtains and linen listed out and you will see rooms come to life. </p><p><b>Seasonal Décor: </b>Get the men involved in the seasonal décor of your home. Especially during the times of festivals. Have them set up streamers, place lamps, change fixtures, do some deep cleaning of the house and more. Assigning tasks that can be taken up over a period of time will help you check things off your list and be assured that the job will get done.</p><p>Men are an integral part of a home and therefore it makes sense to have them take part in the cleaning and doing up of a home. Many times you will find that men take to the jobs they are assigned rather well and it soon becomes a matter of habit rather than a forced act. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>A great meal that is about to be served is further enhanced in terms of an experience when you have a great table setting laid out.</p><p>So you are having guests over for dinner and you have an elaborate meal planned. Have you given a thought to your table settings? More often than not, we make do with the simple plate-spoon-knife-fork and glass set up rather than work on a smart dining table set up. If you want to impress your guests, you don’t necessarily have to have cutlery for a 6-course meal in place. Here are three basic ways that you can play around with to create some great dining table settings.</p><p>If this is a casual family dinner you may want to go with the basic table set up. This will include your large dinner place, a dinner fork to the left and dinner knife to the right. On the outer side of the dinner knife place a dinner spoon. The beverage glass has to be placed on the top right corner of the dinner plate. The glass you choose will be based on the kind of drinks you have served at the table. If you have alcohol being served, an alcohol glass and a water glass are a good combination. To the left of your dinner fork is the napkin and on the left top corner of the dinner plate, a smaller bread plate. Always place the cutlery with the tops facing the center of dining table.</p><p>The informal dinner set up starts with the same basic plate and cutlery layout. To this you will add in a soup spoon to the right of your dinner spoon and a salad fork to the left of your dinner fork. When you look at it from a distance you will see that the layout is in ascending order from the inside out. If you are sitting at such a table, simply remember to work your way from the out to the inside. The salad plate in this case is placed on the dining plate and the napkin over it. In addition to your water and wine glass, you will also include a coffee cup and a saucer.</p><p>A formal dinner set-up takes things another step further. Beginning from the top, you will have separate glasses placed for red and white wines and then a champagne flute. This is in addition to a water glass. In the cutlery you will add in a fish knife to the right of the dinner knife followed by a spoon and cocktail fork. The left of the dinner fork, you will have the fish fork. Dessert spoons are always brought in last, once the table is cleared and the dessert is about to be served. When each course is done, the related wine glass is also cleared away. </p><p>You may enhance your table settings with chandeliers overhead or flower arrangements on the table. It would be a good idea to include a sideboard close on hand to make it easier to clear tables and move on to the next course quickly.</p><p>Setting up a great dining table is a wonderful way of improving the experience of the meal that you are about to host. After all a great dining experience is the perfect way to socialize, formally or informally.</p>",

The colour schemes you choose may be seasonal, giving you a good variety each time the weather changes for the long term. You could consider having bedspreads with vertical stripes paired with cushions that have a horizontal orientation. Or while your cushions have circles, your bedspreads could have lines. Similarly you could play with colour schemes. White pillows with a black satin bedspread or green/yellow, blue/red and several other such combinations. </p><p><b>Splurge on Materials:  </b>Yes cotton is a great material, but then so is down for a duvet or a bedspread. Think satin, chenille and other such fancy materials that give out a great look as well as ensure a comfortable, stylish bed for you to sleep on.</p><p><b>Add on the Comfort Elements: </b>While a great bedspread is a nice thing to have, you can increase its friendliness by adding in some other elements that ensure comfort.

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>You may not have thought of it but frames can be a great way of doing up those blank spaces in your home and bringing them to life.</p><p>There have been times when you are completely done doing up your home and you suddenly find that a wall seems to be bare. It is often quite easy to miss out on one aspect of a room in order to get the broader picture done. In such cases where little else may fit in, you may considering decorating your blank space with some picture frames. There are so many interesting ways in which you can use frames:</p><p><b>Arrange Your Frames Symmetrically: </b>Whatever your space, arranging your frames symmetrically will help give your room a fancier look. You could choose to go with formal symmetry where two sides of your room have mirror images in terms of frames. Alternately, you could choose to place a large central artwork work or mirror and flank both sides with symmetrically frames. To increase the formal look simple add in similar objects on each side of the room.</p><p><b>Symmetrical Groupings: </b>If symmetry is something you enjoy, you may want to consider linear and symmetrical groupings. Have all your frames of the same size and the same theme of image. Arrange these is straight lines and rows to create a great look. This looks works well for a gallery wall of family photos and will serve as a great conversation starter as well. </p><p><b>Create a Wallpaper:</b> You would never really think of it, but you can create a wallpaper out of frames. Consider your bedroom. You usually have a dressing table up against a wall, opposite your bed. Work with frames of varying sizes and shapes to create an interesting wallpaper of sorts that completely covers the length and breadth of your wall around your dressing table mirror. You may choose to go with a theme for the pictures in the frames or even go with blank frames to make a style statement of sorts.</p><p><b>Create a Story: </b>A picture frame wall need not have only frames. While frame of different sizes and shapes can form the core of the design, you can add in a few wall mounted artefacts to try and weave a story on the wall. For example, if you are tracing your child’s growth over the years, you could also try add in their first toy, framing their first blanket, mounting their first painting and much more till you cover all that you need. The great thing about a theme of this nature is that you can constantly update it to give you a great looking space. </p><p><b>Do up a Corner: </b>While you may have taken care of all the walls in your home, there are often corners that remain left out. In such cases, you can think of creating a gallery wall in the L-shape of a dull corner to brighten it up well. A mix of frames, with a spotlight focused on one can make a world of difference to how your corner looks. You may consider using frames of different sizes as well as with interesting coloured borders.</p><p>These are just a few ways in which decorating your home with picture frames can create a look unlike any other attempt. The ability to constantly change pictures and placements makes it a great way to do up your home. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>A hobby corner is that place in your home that you can retreat to whenever you want to spend some time with what you are passionate about. Creating the ideal space is much simpler than you think. </p><p>Almost all of us, irrespective of age have a hobby that we turn to. For some, these hobbies are a passion that they must indulge in at least for a while each day. For others it may be a means of unwinding and relaxing at the end of the day. We would not have really thought of giving a hobby some space in our homes, but there are some great ideas that you can implement to create a hobby corner in your home. Here is how you can go about it.</p><p><b>Choose the right space: </b>  You first have to narrow down on a good space for your hobby corner. Choose one that has good natural light and ventilation.

The best way to conserve space, yet have expansive storage is to go vertical and use your walls. Hooks, racks and shelves along with rails and floating storage cubby holes can be give you a great deal of storage while looking completely aesthetic.</p><p><b>Create a Private Space:</b>For some a hobby is what you pursue when you are alone, or you prefer to pursue it when you are alone. This is when you need to create a sense of privacy for yourself. In a home, you can place decorative room dividers across your space. Alternately you could consider setting up curtain roads and cordoning off the space when you get into it.</p><p><b>Create a look:</b>If your hobby space is part of a larger communal area, then you will want it to look great, yet have an identity of its own. It is important to keep your space neat and clean and ensure that your storage and display system contribute to the aesthetics of the space.</p><p><b>Allow Room for Expansion:</b>Every hobby grows over time and so will yours. It is important that you allow your hobby to have the space it needs to grow. So you may want to have a table that expands when needed. Or shelves that can be added on to when the time comes.</p><p>Having a hobby corner in your home does take up space that you may not really have on hand. In such cases you will need to creative with the space to allow it to double up as both a hobby space and social area when you need it to be.

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Renovating your home is a mammoth task involving a complete change in design. The end result is fabulous. There are several things you must anticipate in the course of preparing your home for renovation. Here are the key things.</p><p>Renovating your home is as huge a task as constructing it. Even more so if you are living in it when the renovation takes place. There are a lot of things you need to be prepared for and that you must expect. There is no clear list of what these are. Our experience has helped us put together a list of what you can expect when you are renovating your home. </p><p><b>There will be dust!: </b>Forget about those exquisite pictures of renovation that you see in interior magazines. No matter how many cloths and tarpaulins you have spread out, you have to be prepared for the large amount of dust that is going to settle all over your home. From the fine brick dust from a wall that is broken down to dust that comes from all the machinery, materials and people that will be in your home temporarily. Make sure that you have all AC ducts and vents sealed before you begin any renovation work.</p><p>Ideally stow away all the décor elements of your home that can gather dust. These include carpets, curtains, cushions and even cloth upholstered sofas. Cover securely all that you cannot put away. Even things like vases, ashtray or intricately carved wooden items can collect an immense amount of dust. You will have a massive cleaning job on your hands at the end of renovation, but putting away some things can really help.</p><p><b>Be Prepared for a Lot of Noise: </b>Renovation means of lot of noise from hammers, drills and other machines. It will a long drawn affair with workers in your home for the duration of working day. If you work from home, have little children or elderly, you may want to consider moving base for a while. If you can handle the noise, find yourself a relatively quiet part of the house where work is not being done or is a distance away. If you find it hard to believe about the sound, the best thing to do would be to check out the nearest construction or renovation that is going on.</p><p><b>Unexpected Changes: </b>Though professional renovation experts plan for every contingency, there are times when something on site warrants a change that you did not expect. A change in plumbing lines when a wall was taken down or an electrical rewiring that was not anticipated when a new element was introduced into a room. Changes can also happen to materials that may be used. There have been times, when the homeowner, in this case you, may feel that something needs to change. Keep in mind that such changes can increase your spending and stretch your budget. But do take heart in the fact that when the job is done well, there are chances of you spending well within your budget or lower than you anticipated.</p><p><b>There can be delays: </b>It is quite possible that you may face a delay in the completion of a renovation job. Unexpected worker holidays, extended weekends, reduction in number of workers and more. It would be best to try and schedule your renovation when there are no major holidays coming up and in good weather. Inclement weather can cause unanticipated delays as well. Sometimes a renovation job gets held up for the smallest of reasons, like unavailability of a particular material or the lack of a crucial element. Take a deep breath, and rework the schedule to make it more manageable with the least addition to your expense.</p><p>These are what you may expect when your home undergoes a renovation. Additionally, you will go through a range of emotions. The lows of seeing something being brought down and the highs of seeing the completed project handed over. Of course, you celebrate all of this with a party in your brand new home. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>A sauna in your home can be an indulgent affair. Yet, done aesthetically and smartly, it can be a great place to unwind at the end of a long day. </p><p>The thought of a sauna in your home will instantly evoke sensations of being pampered, of being toasty and warm in the cold and wet seasons and having something to show off with all the friends and family. Besides the warm feeling, a sauna has other benefits such as being able to sweat the toxins out of your body, ease aching muscles and bones and of course give you some great looking skin. Why do you think the inventors of the sauna, the Scandinavians have the most enviable skin and complexions around? </p><p>Here are some thoughts that will help you bring a sauna into your home:</p><p><b>Pre-fabricated or Customized: </b> A great thing about the interiors industry today is that you can choose a pre-fabricated sauna for inclusion on your home if you find one that best suits you. Alternately you can choose to have one customized to your specific needs. These specifics can be based on décor theme of the rest of the home, the shape of your room for the sauna, the number of people you may want to accommodate and the features that you plan to include. Of course in both cases, you will be needing a significant amount of power and therefore it is one of the things that you have to make provision for at the beginning.  </p><p><b>Indoors or outdoors: </b>Technology and home décor has reached such levels that you can choose to have your sauna indoors or outdoors. Indoors saunas are the most popular considering the number of apartments each city has. Homes that have secure backyards choose to have outdoor models. The only disadvantage in an outdoor model is that it will require a good deal of maintenance since it remains exposed to the elements. </p><p><b>Choice of Materials: </b>A sauna room needs to have materials that keeps in heat to a certain extent yet doesn’t retain it on the material. The last thing you want when settling in for a good sweat is to sit on a bench that will singe your bottom. Cedar is a good choice of wood. Alternately any of the soft woods available easily in the markets and as suggest by your designer will make for good choice. Floors are usually made of concrete or tile. These materials ensure that despite the collection of moisture, there are no germs that can thrive. </p><p><b>Choice of Heat Source: </b>Sources of heat are varied today. The traditional wet and dry sauna uses wood fire or an electrically induced hot stones to increase air temperature. Once the stones have reached a particular temperature water can be sprayed on them for the steam to generate. Another interesting developed is the creation of infrared saunas that cause your body to heat directly from the rays. These are popular and said to be better on the skin that other models. </p><b>The Size of Your Sauna: </b>Always keep in mind the size and shape of your room and the average number of people that you would like your sauna to accommodate. Do not make the ceiling too high or else heating the space will consume more power and the effects of the steam will not be as efficient. Seven feet is as high as you must go for a 4X6ft o 8X10ft room.</p><p>These are ways in which you may bring a sauna room into your home. Created ideally, it can be a wonderful place for you to relax and indulge your friends with too.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>A guest room is a place where your visitor will relax and feel more at home. You can make this place more inviting by setting it up to be a great space. </p><p>Every family has visitors that come over and stay for a while. These may be casual visits or those that have another purpose – like business. No matter what the reason, your guest room will have to be at its best to make your visitor comfortable and at ease in new surroundings. While you may have taken care of the basics like a comfortable bed, bathroom and its essentials etc., there are several things you can do to set up a great guest room and make it inviting and comfortable. Here are some tips to help. </p><p><b>Setting up Your Guest Room: </b> This is the first place to start. Choose a room that has ample natural light coming in and which is preferably not in the noisier part of the house. A guest room that opens directly into your living room may not be very inviting to a guest. </p><p>Once you have the room, set it up, the way you would want it, if you were visiting someone. Ensure that you have a good spacious bed, clean linen, comfortable pillows and a bed cover on. Make sure that the side tables on both sides have lamps that are working. If you can bring in some mood lighting, that would be an additional benefit. Do ensure that you have drinking water and glasses set out as well. </p><p>A guest would appreciate having some cupboard space to themselves. Having a modular wardrobe set up will help you create this additional space, without having to clutter up your own cupboards with things that you may take out. </p><p>If you have planned to have a guest room right from the get go, you may want to include a wardrobe that has a dressing table unit designed into. Go a step further and increase utility by adding in an ironing table as well. This will help make the space more self-sufficient, ensuring your guest does not have to make awkward requests regularly. </p><p>If you have the space do include a writing desk with the essential stationary, this would be a plus point. This could also have charging points for your guest’s personal technology. This could also be a space that is designed to be an extension of your wardrobe.</p><p><b>The Bathroom: </b>A guest will appreciate it the most if he has a nice, clean bathroom to himself. Ensure that the water supply is regular and that heating elements are in good condition. Do be considerate and include basic toiletries and a two fresh bath towels and a set of hand towels as well. Including air fresheners will also be a good idea. Make sure there is ample lighting around the basin. </p><p><b>The Little Details that Count:  </b>Once you have the room set up, it would be a good idea to make things a little more welcoming for a guest. Some of the things you can do are:</p><ul><li>Put in a vase of fresh flowers on the writing table</li><li>Include a written list of simple things such as instructions on how to use the geyser, the family Wi-Fi password.</li><li>Where you have placed all the remotes for the AC/TV/Set top box or music system</li><li>Adding in a small basket of snacks will ensure that you have everything that a guest would need well taken care of. </li></ul><p>A guest room should essentially provide your visitor with the comfort of home and the luxury of being well taken care.

Choose to blend it in or make it stand out in contrast. </p><p>The way you illuminate your home will set a wonderful tone for the ambience and décor of your space. Light fixtures are a various kinds, each lending their own beauty to your home. Based on where and how you plan to use them lamp shades can be used over lights that are wall-mounted, placed on a table, floor-based or simply placed on your entertainment unit or sideboard.</p><p>Here are some aspects you need to think about when using lamps to decorate your home: </p><p><b>The Various Aspects of a Lamp Shade</b></p><p>A lamp shade comes in a range of shapes, sizes and designs. You can choose to bring in one that blends in with the chosen décor theme of your home. Alternately you could also consider a lamp shade that is eye catching and in complete contrast, thus becoming a talking point in your room. </p><p>Ideally choose a lamp that is two-thirds the height of its base. This ensures that your lamp is proportionate no matter where it is placed. When choosing a shade, ensure that it covers all of the hardware in terms of the socket and the immediate wiring. </p><p>Generally a round base to your lamp is best suited to a round shade. The same principle applies to any shape of the base. However, if you are working contrasts, then a round lamp placed on a square table would look best with a square lamp shade. </p><p>A lamp shade is essentially a part of the lamp and will need to blend in with that as well. Usually, lamps come with their respective shades, but you can always consider a mix and match of shades based on the kind of lamp you have, its design and the materials it is made from. </p><p>Lamp shades come in a range of colours. Based on the kind of lighting you expect from them, your colour scheme will change as well. Basically for clear, functional light, you will need light coloured shades. To diffuse lights, you will need darker shades and designs that incorporate smaller detailing, like a Moroccan design shade. </p><p>Translucent shades work extremely well to create mood or ambient lighting. Opaque lamps are ideally suited to those spots where you are sure of dim light doing the job. </p><p>The materials you choose for your lamp shade will also determine its utility and its ability to contribute to the décor of your home. Decorative lamp shades can be created from simple materials like cloth. In fact, cloth shades can be worked on in several ways – from adding embellishments to them, to pleats and even designs on the cloth, to enhance its prettiness. The more elaborate shades can range from materials like metal and glass (coloured or plain).</p><p><b>How to Choose a Lamp Shade</b>Now that you know about the basics of lamp shades, you move on to making a choice for your homes. Here are some points to keep in mind:</p><ul><li><b>Measure your Space: </b>The size of your lamp shade matters the most. If your lamp is being placed on a table, the shade should be in exact or close proportion to the base of the table and not more. </li><li><b>Echo the Décor:</b> The design and patterns on your lamp shade need to blend in with the overall décor of your room. Of course you may want to create a contrast, if you have such interiors going. But in general, a lamp shade works best when it is in seamless placement with the rest of your room. </li><li><b>Be Detail Oriented: </b>Ensure that the lamp shade is the right size and covers socket, bulb and a significant portion of the wiring. The harp of the lamp must never be seen. This is the most important aspect of placing your lamp shade in the perfect place. </li></ul><p>With these thoughts you will be able to pick the perfect lamp shades for your home. Of course your designer will also chip in with suggestions and design themes that best highlight your lamp shades. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Traditionally most homes had elements of copper and brass woven into its décor. Today, these elements have got a special pride of place in homes and make for some fantastic décor elements. All you need to do is use them the right way. </p><p>There are so many ways to decorate your home. From contemporary to classic, to traditional and more, there are several themes that you can choose when picking up artefacts. One that has remained evergreen through the years is the use of brass and copper elements. Perhaps a generation or two ago, such features were common in most homes, being used for storage of various kinds. Over the years, they have now acquired the status of being antiques or traditional, and are extensively used in décor. </p><p>Called metallic décor, popular metal products are made stainless steel, copper and brass. Such products can add to the character of your home and do it in style. Here are some ideas on how you can incorporate brass and copper into your home décor. </p><p>Where can you use copper and brass artefacts? Just about anywhere in your home. Let’s start at the entrance. A traditional brass urli (wide carved brass or copper vessel) can be placed with a water flower arrangement. Today, urlis are available in a range of sizes, making them easy to place anywhere in the house. </p><p>If you have brass and copper lamps, you consider placing them at the corners of staircases, or on the landings. You could also place them outside bedrooms. </p><p>Mid-sized metallic artefacts can find a place just about anywhere. A copper kadai on your wooden center table. Copper plates and cups arranged artistically on the dining table. Small brass pots and vessels can be used as book ends on your bookshelves. Water pots in metal can be placed in discreet corners that may otherwise lay bare. </p><p>For the smaller objects that you have, like ashtrays, miniature pots, small mirrors and the like, any flat surface that needs a pick-me-up will be best suited for these. In fact, if you have bare spots on the walls, you can consider putting some of these up artefacts up as well. </p><p>Now working metals into your décor is not always an easy task. In fact, most often you tend to go overboard. Here is how you can work this into your décor:</p><p><b>Try to Soften the Metallic Look: </b>Metal can have a very strong look, especially copper and brass. These tend to look stark in any environment they are placed in. Aim to soften their look by mixing them with other materials. Copper curtain rods or holders for sheer or velvet drape would look wonderful. Similarly, a brass base to a lighting fixture, with milky white top portion can make for a wonderful lighting element. Aim at a mix and match when using metals. </p><p><b>Work on a Neutral Colour Scheme: </b>With metals being strong in themselves, you will want to place them on a neutral background. Brass works very well with darker shades of black, navy blue, royal purple and the colours of precious stones. Modern day settings also see an extensive use of colours such as gray, white and blue. </p><p><b>Begin Small: </b>It can be quite exciting to bring in metallic décor in your home. However, to prevent things from going overboard, it is best to start small. Start with a small corner and then develop a look for the room. Once you have that done, you can progress to other rooms and tie the looks of each one together.</p><p>Of course, it would be best to also get some inputs from professional designers, who can help create a look for your home. Now would be the best time to crack out all those family heirlooms and put them out on display.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>A meditation space is just what every one of us needs with today’s frenetic pace of life. Creating such a space is rather simple, if you know exactly what aspects you must look into.</p><p>Considering how stressful our lives are these days, it is but natural that we want a space in our home where we can settle in and try and escape from the rigours of daily life. That space has invariably come to be known as the meditation room/space of the house.</p><p>Of course, if you have the space you may consider dedicating an entire room to your meditation space. Alternately you could consider creating a nook in your bedroom or exercise space that you can retreat into. Here is how you can go about creating a contemplative space in your home. </p><p><b>Choosing the Right Spot: </b>Just as you would for your reading corner, you need to choose the perfect space for your meditation room or corner. Take a look at the rooms in your home. If any one of them offer you a great view of a garden or greenery; allow a lot of natural sunlight, pick that. You must also ensure that the room offers you some good ventilation, while being insulated from generally loud sounds like that of traffic.</p><p>If you find a space in your home that may be suitable for this, but is currently being used for something else, then you must consider redecorating that part of your home. Repurposing the area will come to you quite naturally. </p><p><b>Do up the Space: </b>The first step to creating your area for meditation will be to remove all the clutter and unnecessary elements you may find in it. Allow for only a place to sit, a small stool or side table to keep things like a lamp, some water, a music system with speakers, some aromatherapy candles and the like. Ensure that the space is clean and always remains so. As much as possible, allow for fresh, natural air to come into the space. This creates a lot of positive energy in the space. To ensure your privacy and to allow such fresh air, you could choose to include sheer, pastel shaded shades that create a lovely ambience for your meditation space.</p><p><b>Creating the Right Ambience: </b>Being able to meditate in a space is about creating the right ambience. You can do this in multiple ways, starting with the décor of your space. Choose to go with light pastel shades for your cushion, meditation mat, sheer curtains and the like. You may also want to bring in some paintings that denote soothing scenes like that of an ocean and a sunset or anything else that you may feel good looking at.</p><p>Work on the lighting of the space. It is best to invest in mood lighting fixtures that gives you control over it all. You may also want to bring in aromatherapy candles which create a soothing atmosphere while lighting up your space beautifully. Do also consider bringing in a lot of greenery in the form of indoor plants. This will enhance the serenity of your space immensely. </p><p>You will also want to bring in a simple music system with speakers to help you plan calming music while you meditate.</p><p>With this, you will be able to create your own private meditation space that you can head into every time you feel the need. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Your living room is the perfect space to introduce a home library. A few tweaks and some good suggestions from your designer will give you the perfect place to display your books and curl up with one any time you please.</p><p>There is something so perfect about having a home library. Whether it is one that takes up an entire wall in your home, or just a cozy nook, it is a comforting feature to have. In a time when personal technology seems to be gradually replacing books that you can hold, a home library is the perfect way to encourage the habit of reading and build up a collection that you can share with the family.</p><p>If you are looking to include a home library, your living room would be the perfect place to have it in. Here are some cool ways to bring home a library and curl up with a book anytime you want to.</p><p><b>Behind the Sofa: </b>Most living rooms have a sofa that is placed against a wall. The simplest way to bring in a library is to utilize this wall. Pull your sofa a bit forward and place a bookshelf against the wall. If space is a constraint, fit in a bracket that gives you enough of head space and include shelves going as high as you please. You can even do this behind two single-seats and use the space in between to put in a step stool to access books on top.</p><p>Floating shelves at varying heights can also be placed above sofas to ensure that no floor space is taken up.</p><p><b>Make Use of Awkward Corners: </b>There are a few living rooms that end up with awkward corners that cannot really be used in a productive way. This is the space that you can use to include a nice bookshelf. Choose to have an angled vertical bookcase that can simply be eased into the corner. Alternately, you can choose to have a side table or two fitted into the corners. Use the shelves and the top of each of these to create a library for yourself. If you do end up with a space in between side tables, place a potted plant. </p><p><b>Use Part of an Extended Wall: </b>If you have a living-cum-dining room, you will find that you have a singular wall that runs through the two spaces. Use one or part of one wall to put up a floor to ceiling book shelf. You may also consider using such a bookshelf to create a seamless flow into your dining room, while differentiating between the two spaces. After all, there are scores of us who wouldn’t think twice about picking a book and heading from living room to dining room. Having a designer step ladder close on hand to access books on the higher shelves would be a good idea. It also makes for nice décor addition to your space.</p><p><b>Make Use of Existing Décor: </b>If you already have an entertainment unit in your living room, and you use it only for your TV and its accessories, you will find that you already have a lot of book shelf space just waiting to be utilized. Spread your collection of books across the shelf. Make sure to organize your books vertically and horizontally to give it an interesting dimension. This will give your living room a great look.</p><p>These are some of the ways in which a library may be introduced into your home, especially in your living room. Do make it a point to consult a designer to see what best works for the space that you have on hand.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>A garage is a space not only for your car, but for a range of storage solutions that you may not have thought possible till today. With some help from your designer, you can get the most out of your garage and reduce the clutter in your homes.</p><p>If you live in an independent home or a villa, a feature that you will enjoy is that of an enclosed garage. Of course this is a space to park your car and keep it safe from the elements. Over time, the garage has evolved to become a storage space for things that are not really used on a regular basis in a home. </p><p>That being said, actually creating storage space that will serve your purpose, while ensuring that you do not take up too much space leaving your car in the lurch, is something that is best left to architects and designers of your space.

You may choose to have them at any level – overhead, at eye level or even a series of stacked cabinets beginning on the floor. Any way you choose will create storage space unlike anything else you may have in the house. </p><p><b>Create a loft: </b>If you have a garage with a high ceiling, then this would be the ideal setting for the creation of a loft.

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Many an empty roof space has the potential to be converted into a lovely rooftop bar. A great designer will help you create an exclusive entertainment space that will have your friends constantly wanting to hang out with you.</p><p>If you are among the lucky ones to have a relatively large roof space, then there are so many ideas that you can explore. Entertaining guests is by far the most popular idea and what better way to do it than with a bar space created on your roof. If this idea has intrigued you enough, here are some ways in which you can go about it. </p><p><b>Creating the Bar Space: </b>The essential part of a rooftop bar in your home is having a good bar area created. For this, you will need to have electrical work done to ensure you have enough of light as well as the option to bring in a small refrigerator and a microwave to heat up snacks.</p><p>Your designer will narrow down on a spot on the terrace which is best suited to the creation of your bar area. You can have an elaborate space that includes a bar table and seating with large shelves to display your alcohol. Alternately you could choose to have a smaller version of this concept created in proportion to the space that you have. </p><p>Irrespective, you will want the option of the bar to be completely closed or open, to handle weather conditions prevalent when you use the space. For this, your designers may suggest retractable awnings overhead. They may also suggest that you include a roller shutter that can be brought down or wrapped around the bar area to keep it secure and safe from the elements.</p><p><b>Seating arrangements: </b>There are scores of ways in which to create great seating arrangements. The whole idea of a rooftop bar is to relax and lounge about. For this, you can consider low profile seating such as diwans and settees. For the folks who prefer to have regular height chairs you may consider bringing in bar stools, easy chairs or fancy backed single chairs that are portable and can be shifted around the roof. People love to interact and will want the ability to create small break away groups.</p><p>Good seating also means have enough of arrangements for people to keep their glasses, bottles or snacks on comfortably. For this tables may be built into walls at full standing level. Another option is to have tables that are low slung and placed around your various seating arrangements. Make sure to have a central table where you can place trays of food and drink. Smaller tables can be of the portable variety so that your guests can move them around. </p><p>Make sure to include a space where you guests can safely stow away their personal belongings and charge their personal technology as well.</p><p><b>Lighting and Entertainment options: </b>The lighting matrix you introduce on your rooftop bar will have to be a mix of functional and mood lighting. Ensure that the fixtures you bring in are insulated against the elements so that you have a safe environment. Your designer will be able to guide you on the lighting options to bring in and the various mounts that you can use.</p><p>A great rooftop bar will also have some good entertainment options. Nothing like a wide screen to watch an ongoing match with your friends. Or perhaps a night of dancing with friends. This would need a good quality audio system and speakers incorporated into the whole set up. </p><p>These are the basic elements that go into the creation of a rooftop bar. A lot of the structure and placement will depend on the space that you have and how much of it is exposed to the elements. A good designer will be able to make the best of the space you have and give you a wonderful area to entertain guests in. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Modern day architecture is immensely influenced by historical creations, the complexities of some that defy logic even today. A number of modern day creations display influences of olden day structures but with the technological brilliance of today. </p><p>Across the world, architecture is influenced by history, the people of its times and the requirements of the community. Historically, architecture has passed down through the generations, been moulded to suit current needs, yet has remained reflective of the culture of the people. This is perhaps extensively seen in the architecture of Europe. </p><p>Seven architectural structures have been earmarked across the world as representative of unbelievable advancement in the ancient world. Of course, the modern world has its own set of architectural marvels thanks to technology, but it is still these ancient wonders that keep us mesmerized. Of course wonders such as the Colosseum, the pyramid of Giza, the Great Wall of China and Machu Pichu, along with the Taj Mahal, The Eiffel Tower and the Leaning Tower of Pisa are architectural wonders in their own rights, but here is a look at some more:</p><p><b>Chand Baori in India: </b>Located in Rajasthan, this is the deepest step well in the world at 100ft deep and a wonderful example of how patterns can be incorporated into architecture. The well is made up of 3500 steps and arranged in 13 levels with an inverted V pattern created into it. Though the construction process has not fully been charted, it is for sure that the progress was tedious and long. </p><p><b>Sacsayhuaman in Peru: </b>One of the first questions that arises with this structure is how the massive boulders were moved into place? Despite years of earthquakes devastating the area, this structure has remained intact with each one of the interlocking stones still in place. So much so that not even a piece of paper can pass between the cracks. Some of the boulders that make up the three walls of this structure are as heavy as 120 tonnes. Successive conquerors believed that this structure was the work of devils since they couldn’t figure out how it was made.</p><p><b>Leshan Giant Buddha in China: </b>This is the world’s largest carved Buddha and stands at 232 feet high in the air. Each of the fingers of this Buddha measures 11ft and the statue measures an immense 92ft across the shoulders. He was constructed to placate the water spirits that he overlooks as the statue is placed at the confluence of three rivers. What makes the structure even more intriguing is the fact that the architectural elements such as the coils of buns in Buddha’s hair, makes up a complex drainage system. This passes through the length of the statue ensuring that it does not get ruined by the water that is surrounded by.</p><p><b>Teotihuacan in Mexico: </b>This excavation site of an urban complex in Mexico shows high levels of city development and architectural finesse. The city is built based on astronomical predictions and at the horizon of the city lies the point where the sun sets on each anniversary of the Mesoamerican calendar ending. The city is still being excavated and each passing day brings in new elements to the architecture of the place.</p><p><b>Underground Churches of Lalibela in Ethiopia: </b>In a remote city of Lalibela in Ethiopia lies 11 monolithic churches that have all been carved out of a single block of volcanic rock. These underground churches were created in the 12 and 13th centuries and are interconnected with a complex set tunnels.</p><p><b>El Mirador in Guatemala: </b>This is believed to be the cradle of the Mayan civilization and contains what is believed to be the first highway system of the world. Though found in the 1926, it was only charted out in 1978. It is found to have a complex network of roads that connect the main monuments of the city and further more to other cities around.</p><p><b>Mohenjo-Daro in Pakistan: </b>The Hrithik Roshan movie soon to release will have some level of ancient Mohenjodaro’s architecture on display. Among its interesting features are a massive plumbing and sewage system, indoor toilets and a drainage system that ran under the city just like we have today.</p><p>A look at the architecture of ancient civilizations shows that we have a strong history to fall back on in terms of an architectural foundation. While we now have technology on our side these days, a lot of our basics continue to remain the same.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>A number of architects and home owners today choose to retain a tree that may be naturally growing in the center of a plot. Advances in architectural designing have ensured that such trees can easily be part of the design of a home’s design.</p><p>One of the first victims in man’s quest to develop land and build architectural wonders are the trees we have carpeting our landscape. While many home owners still prefer to chop away trees rather than work around them with their architecture, there are an increasing number of architects that try and retain trees in a plot and plan the house around it. This means incorporating the tree into the design of the home, allowing it to pass through it at times. </p><p>There are many ways in which architects have worked around creating homes that retain trees. Here are some ideas:</p><p><b>Passing through the house: </b>If the tree is placed in the center of a plot, homes have been designed to have the tree run through the center. This is done in multiple ways. There are homes that have vertical glass enclosures that run through the house, circling the tree. This allows for gorgeous natural light to come into the home, yet ensures level of safety to those living in it. The tree is also given ample space to grow, without it posing any danger.</p><p>Another way is to provide openings for the tree to pass through and build elements that complement having the tree in your home. One way is to perhaps build a spiral staircase around it. One in wood is definitely complement the tree. You could also make it the central focus of the room and place your décor around it.</p><p>In a living room, you can have a display table built around the base. Alternately, you could consider having a sort of seating arrangement built around it. </p><p><b>Placed at the periphery of the house:  </b>Many homes have trees that are close to the edges of the property. In such cases the façade of the home is designed such that it includes the tree. While some designs have floors that encircle the tree allowing it to ‘pass’ through, others make way for the trees to continue to grow freely. This includes verandahs, balconies and even terraces that have a semi-circular design created.</p><p>Now it is not really easy to make way for tree in the design of your home. Most architects will hire a tree conservationist or an expert to help them figure out how to protect the roots of the tree as the construction comes up. It is also essential to understand how to improve on the strength of the house’s foundation. Roots can often dig deep into the foundation weakening it. </p><p>It will also have to be decided early on about how much space will actually be set aside in the design of the home to accommodate the tree. The rate of growth has to also be anticipated to ensure that the space allotted is enough.</p><p>The idea of including a tree in the design of a home is a great one if executed properly.

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Red Oxide floors are not necessarily a thing of the past. With the right skilled labour and set pattern of maintenance, you will be able to bring in a slice of traditional architecture to your home.</p><p>A distinguishing features of South Indian homes of yore are the red oxide flooring. Now primarily relegated to being a memory of grandma’s home, red oxide floors have been replaced with a range of tiles and stones. Naturally this has led to a decline in the number of masons and skilled labour who are well-versed with laying these floors.</p><p>Indian architecture has been witnessing a revival of sorts as far as traditional construction methods are concerned. There are a few dedicated architects who are working towards preserving the knowledge of ancient times. A red oxide floor is still available for those who may want it, though a bit of hunting around is required for the right labour force.</p><p>If your architect/interior designer has access to oxide floor specialists, then this is one floor you may want to consider and here is why. South Indian homes benefitted greatly from red oxide floors because of their ability to cool a home naturally. Despite the sweltering heat, you would be able to walk bare feet on your floor in the house and feel comfortable.</p><p>What most people don’t know is that oxide flooring come in a range of colours and not just red. While there are numerous shades of red, there are also homes that made use of black, green and blue oxide flooring as well. </p><p>Besides the benefit of the red oxide floors being extremely cooling for a house, they are also an economically viable option for any home, when compared to tiles. Also, they provide a seamless look to the floor, something that is not possible with tiles. The only thing to keep in mind is that oxide tends to absorb moisture and so humid climes may not really be a good idea for them. These are best used indoors.</p><p>The floors are also extremely long lasting, considering that the same material is also used in applications for anti-rust, iron, and pigments and polishing.  </p><p>Once you have the experts come in to do your red oxide flooring, there is a period of curing and care that you must undertake to ensure you have a great floor. On the following day water will have to be sprinkled on the floor all through the day to ensure that it remains moist enough. On the second day, your mason will wet the floor and leave the water standing to check for white patches. If they do appear, then the process of covering the floor with water will be repeated till the patches stop.</p><p>Once done, it is important the no one walk on the floor for a minimum of four days. A few days later, once the floor is completely dry, you will have to wet mop the floor. The mason will check for any level variations and smooth them down with sandpaper. Red wax is not applied on the surface to give it that finish we are so familiar with and to lock in the color. Once again the floor is off limits for a few days till the wax dries completely.</p><p>In terms of maintaining the floor remember to use clean water that is not from a borewell or treated water. The chemical and mineral content in this can destroy your floors. Acids should also not be used to clean the floor. Simple things like lemon juice and curd can leave ugly stains on the floor so a certain level of being careful is what is needed. Mopping the floor with water on a daily basis is essential. </p><p>This is how you can bring in an oxide floor into your home and ensure that you have touch of the good old times in your décor. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>Monica-Geller Bing’s apartment in Friends enjoys the status of being an evergreen space that many would like to replicate. It has a kitschy, quirky look which is easily achievable with the right choice of furniture and accessories.</p><p>‘Friends’, the serial, achieved a cult status like no other perhaps. Though the serial officially came to an end more than a decade ago, its reruns today have garnered a whole new generation of fans. A significant part of the serial is based out of Monica Geller’s apartment, one that is quirky and primarily vintage. Over the years many attempts have been made at recreating that apartment in homes across the world. While décor merchandise was once easily available, today it is the question of using your smarts to replicate the home. </p><p>Greg Grande the designer of the sets and of course Monica’s apartment wanted to achieve “a whole new kind of eclectic taste with a flea-market, whimsical, and anything-goes style.” If you want to try and recreate that home, where honestly, nothing ever goes out of style, then here are some ways to go about it.</p><p>Start with the flooring. If you have the chance to bring in a wooden floor, do that. This can be in the form of artificial tiles that replicate wood or an actual wood floor. If not for most of your home, then you could opt for this in your living and dining rooms. Allow your furniture and large rugs to do the natural demarcation of spaces in the rooms. The layout of the home is a very 70s look, which you can easily achieve with a bit of mix and match with colours for your rugs.</p><p>The comfortable couches in Monica’s apartment are the most loved. But if you look closely, they are not matched and are not a set. Try to do the same with your choice of couches. Make sure the difference in subtle in styling, colour and patterns. Just make sure that the main couch you choose is of a neutral colour so that it doesn’t clash with the rest of the colour scheme that you take up.</p><p>The idea is to ensure that you have enough of seating space. Throw in a foot stool or two and a low slung table and you have a great replica. Of course, bringing in that carved wooden table from grandma’s home to use as a side table for parties will complete the look.</p><p>Bring in potted plants just about anywhere you can think of. On the fridge, on the way to the other rooms, at the corner of the sink, on an empty shelf and even on wall mounted holders. This gives the space a lovely, fresh feeling and a sense of happiness as well. </p><p>If you look around Monica’s room you will see that there are several lighting fixtures all over the place. Those that are wall mounted are in pairs and are of the slightly Victorian, wrought-iron handle bars and closed sconces variety. The house also has a lot of table and floor lamps placed at strategic places. This will add to the charm of your home.</p><p>When it comes to curtains and blinds, you have to use them both. The main window that overlooked ‘ugly naked guy’s / Ross’s apartment has both a rattan blind and a thick curtain. Even the little kitchen window has a delicate curtain attached to it. </p><p>The house is also strewn with a number of side tables both in glass and carved wood. You may not have place for all of them, but if you have for a few, make sure you mix them up well. </p><p>And finally, let’s not forget the rugs, cushions and throws that are just about everywhere in the apartment. The benefit of that neutral sofa will be seen each time you throw a different rug on it.</p><p>While you may not want purple walls, a bright shade will be great. Also slap onto the walls a lot of French art frames and accessorize with things aplenty. </p><p>These are just some of the ways in which you can bring to your own home some of Monica Geller’s décor. Play around a bit and see what you get. </p>",

That is where some innovative furniture can come to the rescue. Choosing the right pieces of furniture can help you bring down the clutter and create a lovely contemporary living space. Here are some ideas on the kinds of storage furniture that you need to pick.</p><p><b>Use the Walls: </b> One of the best ways to increase storage without adding elements to the floor space of your home is to use the walls. There are a range of shelving options that are wall-mounted, giving you ideal storage and display space. In fact, there are several furniture elements that may be enhanced, simply by adding in such shelves.

Take the modular kitchen – you have a superbly designed kitchen that can always make space for an island or an extension on one leg of the kitchen to include a peninsula. This can be used for dining, additional work space or anything you fancy.</p><p>Similarly with wardrobes – built in units provide multiple means of storage. Besides that, they may also be designed to include dressing table, open shelves for book cases and even an ironing board if you so prefer. This enhance the functionality of the unit and gives your space a lovely look. </p><p>Foyer units serve the purpose of being a shoe rack if needed. Additionally, the surface can be used to create décor elements that create a lovely welcome to those entering your home. Add in a few open shelves on the top and you have a storage and display set up unlike any other.</p><p>Study Tables too can be created such that they are partially wall mounted or built into a bed, giving you more space and versatility with your space. </p><p><b>Work the Space you Have:  </b>There are so many places that often go unnoticed when looking for great ways to make use of the space that you have. Here are some spaces to consider:</p><ul><li>The area below your staircase.</li><li>The space at the head and foot of your bed.</li><li>Awkward L-shaped corners of the house that can be fitted with customized furniture.</li><li>The space behind a sofa</li></ul><p>These are some ways in which to expand the functionality of your home without really compromising on the space that you have. These pieces of furniture or even these approaches will help you create a space unlike any other. Versatility, style and functionality all come together beautifully when the space is well thought of.</p>",

It is however a great means to having a good idea of what your home could look like.</p><p>Buying a home is a huge investment both financially and emotionally. You will want it to be the best because it is something you are investing in for the entire family and possibly for a generation or two ahead. An interesting feature most apartment and independent home builders have introduced in their projects is the presence of a model home.</p><p>A model home is one apartment or home that represents the complete picture of a residence that the builder would like to put forward to his prospective buyers.

From the architectural, structural and interiors perspective, a floor plan can give you the basis from which to begin.</p><p>The basics of any building begins with an architectural drawing. Whether you are a builder, architect or an appraisal officer, the floor plan is where you make a beginning. A basic floor plan will tell you in precise scaled down size – the area the home covers, its structure, the air and movement circulation plans, locations of key elements like stairs, windows and doors as well as show you the layout of each of your rooms. A floor plan will also indicate the functionality of home</p><p>The overall floor plan is a two-dimensional drawing. So while you see everything clearly in terms of placement and functionality, ambience is not something that is clear. This is because materials are not something that can be displayed in a floor plan drawing. </p><p>One of the best ways to read a floor plan is to use your imagination and place yourself within the drawing. With this, you can create mental walkthrough of the entire space and understand how each room is going to look. Plans come with detailed legends that will help you understand the scale at which a floor plan has been created this is usually placed on the top right hand corner of the drawing. The general rule of thumb is depict a foot with a quarter inch. This varies only in a few cases. </p><p>In a drawing, the walls are the most important architectural structure are displayed.

This means that a plan will now show you where interior décor elements such as cabinets and larger furniture can be placed. </p><p>Every door and window placement is important in the creation of a floor plan drawing. These have to be accurate right down to the last inch. Doors are indicated with a straight line that is drawn perpendicular to the wall and windows are shown with three lines. </p><p>The pattern of the door can also be indicated with these drawings- French and double doors with two arcs. A drawing will also indicate the direction in which a door will swing. This is especially important when it comes to placing furniture in your home.</p><p>The stairs are an important architectural detail that is an essential part of a floor plan.

Stairs are indicated with a parallel lines.</p><p>The transition to a ceiling is not clearly indicated with floor plans, however, there are certain conventions followed to indicate where are ceiling begins. This is done with the help of dotted lines. </p><p>An accurate floor plan is essential to ensure that you plan your interiors properly, especially from the interiors perspective. Since furniture is measured to suit a space, an inaccurate drawing can result in disproportionately sized pieces.

There are several ways to bring both the décor and lifestyle to you and your family, here in India.</p><p>There is something so enticing about the Mediterranean lifestyle and homes. In fact, you find several builders, across the world trying to bring in a slice of this styling into the homes they make. The home décor of Spain or Greece or Italy are much loved all over, especially for its ability to look laidback, yet be completely stylish. </p><p>Mediterranean décor is characterized by light colors, compact pieces of furniture with an ornate element woven in, heavy hardware and textured walls. If you want to bring in a bit of this into your home, here is how you can do it:</p><p><b>Work on your color palette: </b>Mediterranean colors reflect the sea and sky. Also, if you travel around the region, you will find a lot of burnt terracotta, hues of lavender and yellow also finding their way into home décor. Consider this color palette for your home if you plan to go the Mediterranean way.</p><p><b>Bring in the Tiles: </b>Mediterranean homes tend to have a lot of tile work done for the interiors. Consider bringing in tiles or your floors, portions of your walls or even for backsplashes in the bathrooms and kitchens. Of course, your designer will take care of aesthetics and ensure that you are not going overboard. If you do not like the maintenance work that tiles involve, you can consider simulate tiles with textured walls or stenciled designs on walls.  </p><p><b>Add in the Accessories: </b>Think Roman artefacts when you think of Mediterranean accessories. Place a bronze urn at the entryway of your home or bring in delicate light accessories that have filigree work on them. Multi-colored mosaic light shades bring in a very Moroccan night market look to your home and of course a wrought iron table and chair set will be just the thing.</p><p><b>Textures for your Walls: </b>There are so many ways in which you can achieve that lovely textured look that is so characteristic of Mediterranean homes. Your designer will suggest layering of paints, or perhaps some glazed work on your walls as well. You can also consider creating the look and feel of a plaster wall through one of the many methods that interior designers have. All this will help you create a Mediterranean styled wall that will complete the look of your home. </p><p>Once you have your Mediterranean home, you may also want to make the best of it with a Mediterranean lifestyle. If you are wondering how to go about it, here are some tips that will help.</p><p><b>Go on the Mediterranean Diet: </b>Your home must incorporate a kitchen garden. The Mediterranean lifestyle is all about eating fresh, light and healthy. Make sure you have all your basics planted and enjoy salads and fresh soups from the ingredients in your kitchen garden on a regular basis. No matter what food you eat, it is also important that you are moderate. </p><p><b>Spend Time with Your Family: </b>The Mediterranean family is all about spending time with each other. Weekend potlucks over good wine and food are the norm. Stopping by and catching up on a regular basis is also the accepted form of life. The folks from this region are not gossip inclined and tend to keep to themselves to a large extent. They value privacy a lot and expect that your respect that sentiment. </p><p><b>Take on the Simple Life:</b> The Mediterranean people are about living the simple life. Walking and cycling everywhere they need to go, they are content with the simple pleasures in life. Their consumption of junk and pre-packaged food is less. Fresh cooking on a daily basis is the norm. Wastage is also controlled to a large extent.</p><p>This is the general lifestyle of the Mediterranean people and would be a great life to live in a home that is designed on the Mediterranean lines of décor. Though it is easy to write about it and perhaps not practically viable in our country, we can, in our own small ways make an attempt to work towards a simpler life. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b> Designing homes today has evolved to take on contemporary hues, while retaining a lot of our traditional designs. Here is a look at this evolutionary process. </p><p>The creation of a home has been the basic need of humanity for time immemorial now. When homes were first devised, they were all about the practicality than they were about aesthetics. Materials would be what were easily available. Considering the nomadic nature of man, these homes were built and abandoned, only to be rebuilt in newer, more prosperous locations.</p><p>Aesthetics is a consideration that slowly came into play. With each generation and the fact that the Indian diaspora is vast, we have had multiple influences in the creation of homes. These homes had social and religious sentiments also woven into its design. Here is a look at how the traditional Indian home has now gradually given way to a more contemporary style, while, in some cases retaining an essence of yesteryears:</p><p><b>The Layout of the House: </b>In the earlier days, large families used to occupy homes and this meant that homes had to be large and compartmentalized to include multiple families. Today, with the nuclear family being the norm, homes, including independent houses, have shrunk in size, and have a more linear approach to segmented sections in the house. This allows for privacy, yet the comfort of knowing that your family is close by. </p><p><b>The Entryway:   </b>Homes of olden days used to have large porticos and foyers to welcome their guests with traditional ceremonies. Based on which part of the country you are in, these porticos could be enclosed in the center of the house, or be placed at the front of the house. Today, these spaces are reduced to foyers, which still serve as the entry ways to homes. They are also as functional in nature as they were earlier, with modular units such as sideboards and floating shelves serving as storage and decorative spaces. </p><p><b>The Living Room:    </b>The living room, in earlier times used to be segregated into two parts, usually allowing for men and women to socialize separately on a daily basis. Should the family have a get-together, then the large space available would serve perfectly. The living room today continues to be a place for socialization, though its size has reduced. In fact, the space has been split in some homes with a lounge area/family room or bar area serving as additional spaces for entertainment. </p><p><b>The Dining Room: </b>This is a space that by and large continues to remain the same. Its placement however may have evolved a bit. From large dining spaces for large families to a dining room that works for a family, with a modular table that can open out to add more dining seats. Also, with open kitchens now becoming the now, island dining tables in the kitchen itself are an interesting addition that we see in apartments as well as independent homes.</p><p><b>The Kitchen: </b>The kitchen used to be the domain of women of the family and needed to be spacious to accommodate all the work that needed to be done. The kitchen was also used as a storage space for fresh produce, considering the lack of refrigeration options. The kitchen also had to accommodate a lot of prep work for food and space for hired help. With the development of technology, the ease of machines and modular kitchen spaces, this is one space of a home that is changed considerably. While most of the functions remain the same, it is the layout that has changed to be more compact. </p><p><b>Bedrooms: </b>Bedrooms remain by and large the same, with the master bedroom being created for the owners of the house. Children have their own bedrooms these days, which was not really the norm earlier. Servants’ quarters are restricted to larger homes with available space. </p><p>In this way we see how the traditional home has evolved to make way for a more contemporary form of living, yet it retains the essence of our heritage and culture.</p>",

From faucets to door handles, incorporating new hardware and fixtures will instantly lift the looks of your bathroom, even if you choose not to replace the cabinetry. Look for something ornate, yet at the same time easy to clean and manage.</p><p><b>Bring in Some New Lights:  </b>The bathroom often has to make do with the simplest of functional lights usually because it is not given the importance due to it in terms of décor. When you are refurbishing your bathroom, investing in some ornate light fixtures to illuminate your bathroom would be a good idea. You can have these installed in the center of your bathroom and around the mirror as well. If you have a separate shower unit, another may be placed there as well.</p><p>These five simple ways will help you create a bathroom unlike its predecessor.

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b> You have now decided to go ahead and build a home of your own. Naturally, there is a lot that needs to be done. From planning, till the execution of your home and its handover, a lot of elements have to be planned and processes put in place. Here are some thoughts that will help you lay the groundwork for the creation of your new home:</p><p><b>Setting a Budget: </b> The creation of every home requires a budget to be set. You will need a budget for several stages in the creation of your home. You need a budget to invest in a piece of land and all the paperwork involved. You will also have to budget for an architect’s services, building materials, and labour. With that done, you will need to hire an interior designer for your interiors and also investing in setting up your home.</p><p>What is important in each of these budgets is to fix an amount that you are comfortable with. You have to remember that while your home is under construction, you still will be paying for your current home and lifestyle. Always budget for at least 10% higher than your budget limit to make room for sudden expenses, price fluctuations and even a change in original plans. </p><p><b>Find the Property of your Choice: </b>A lot of thought needs to go into finding the right property for your home. Location continues to be the most important consideration. You may find a good property at a great price in a location that may not be suitable for you on a regular basis. Let monetary considerations not be the driving factor for the selection of a property. Look into aspects such as the appreciation prospects, the proximity of the property to all your needs, how much it cuts your commute for work and entertainment, what projects may be coming up in the future.</p><p><b>Hire an Architect:  </b>A good architect will be the one reason you have a great home. You will have to look for an architect with experience in the local terrain. Detailed discussions on your expectations for the home will have to be had. A good architect will ensure that all your needs are incorporated into a home within the budget you have set aside. He will make recommendations on materials best suited to bring the home of your imagination to life. He also needs to be the kind to play a devil’s advocate and let you know when something does not work right. An in-depth look at his track record will help you make the right decision.</p><p><b>Plan your interiors and exteriors: </b>It is a good idea to hire an interior designer at the same time as the architect. Usually, you will find organizations that offer both services making things easier for you. Planning your interiors and exteriors and their layout and final look will make creation and execution of interiors much easier for all. It will also ensure that you don’t end up with surprises when your home is handed over.  </p><p><b>Manage your New Home: </b>When planning your new home, there are certain aspects to keep in mind. Not every fancy design and material you see in home images online and in publications are possible to bring into your home. Ensure you create a home that is a reflection of your identity as you have to live in it for the long term. </p><p>With these basic concepts in mind, you will be able to design and set up a great home for you and your family and for the generations to come. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> Modular furniture is a great way of doing up your home to give it an aesthetic look while enhancing its functionality. Here are some modular furniture ideas for you to contemplate. </p><p>When doing up the décor of your home, the focus is always on getting the most out of a décor element. It should be able to do its job while looking aesthetically pleasing as well. Apartments and independent homes offer you a wide range of floor spaces to deal with. Over time, and for the sake of convenience premium modular units have found their way into homes. They great part about these modular units is that the looks they exude are luxurious while their price tags remain wallet-friendly. Here are some modular home furnishing solutions that you can consider.</p><p><b>The Living Room:</b> The living room is the hub of all the activity in your home. It is where the family gets together, relaxes and enjoys each other’s company. In most homes, it is also a space where each member of the family finds a nook to keep their things. Often this leads to clutter. You may not have thought of it, but a modular entertainment unit is just what you may need.</p><p>There are a range of units created for every kind of home and space. If you are living in an apartment and have limited space, you could think of the Monica entertainment unit that wall mounts your TV, along with a floating shelf to place your media. Right below is another floating shelf fitted with drawers that may be used in multiple ways. In fact, if you find your family cluttering the living room with their things, you can even assign a drawer to each to place their belongings. The shelves are designed in such a way that you can add on personal touches in the form of decorative items and curios.</p><p>The Jesse Entertainment unit is perfect for a home that has low-profile furniture settings. You have a side table styled cabinet unit over which goes your TV. A partially open shelf with a set of closed cabinets makes for your storage space. What makes this unit especially lovely to have is an independent set of vertical wall mounted shelves where you can place books, CDs, your personal technology and even mementoes. A perfect way to have your living room look neat and classy. </p><p><b>The Kitchen: </b>What better place to think of going modular than the kitchen.

Why not move to something more elegant and well designed. Modular wardrobe units are of several kinds and designs ensuring that you have something for your specific needs. The Goldfinch Wardrobe, for example is ideal for a single person with enough of hanging as well as horizontal shelves to accommodate all your things. Ample space between shelves ensures you are not cramming things in a small space. </p><p>The Cardinal wardrobe is perfect for a couple with dedicated his and her spaces with a variety of shelving options. The drawers also give you space for smaller things like jewelry, cosmetics or even important documents.</p><p>Choose your cupboard based on your individual needs and the prominent kind of clothing you have. If you sarees and shirts dominate, you will need more hanger space. If jeans and tops constitute a large part of your wardrobe, then horizontal shelves are what you must look at. Having cupboards that have full length mirrors built in are a great help too. </p><p>These are some of the great options you have in terms of modular furniture for your home. Increase the style quotient of each one of your spaces and enjoy your home to the fullest. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> The balcony and the lawn have a great deal of flexibility in terms of the décor that you can conceptualize for them. Here are some ideas that will give your family a favorite corner of their own. </p><p>There are two broad categories of homes today. Those that are in high-rises and those that are independent homes. Both kinds of residential spaces have a good number of takers. This ensures that interior design market is flourishing thanks to varying demands.</p><p>Among the spaces in an apartment that seek the attention of an interior designer are the balconies that you have in your home. On much the same note, an independent home will have a garden space and therefore landscaping, and outdoor furniture placement becomes the need of the hour.</p><p>Here is some advice on how you can do up these two spaces in your home.</p><p><b>The Balcony </b></p><p>The balcony is a multi-faceted space and may be used in a range of ways depending on the space that you have. Some apartments have balconies that run around them with entryways from multiple rooms. In such cases, you may consider splitting up your décor to suit each segment. </p><p>For the portion that is attached to your living room, you can consider making it an extension to your living space. This works especially well when you are entertaining. Place planters interspersed with little LED lights to illuminate the space at night, on the outer section of the railings. If you have an empty wall on one side, consider a vertical garden which will add to the beauty of your space, without taking up precious floor area. You can also have a collapsible dining table built into the wall that you can open out on pleasant evening.</p><p>Consider installing a collapsible canopy overhead for the really hot days. Your seating arrangements too, will depend on the size of balcony that you have. Foldable chairs are a good option to have, especially when you have guests over. Alternately, a diwan or individual settees will work really well.  </p><p>If you would like to make this a lounge area in summers, you can even consider bringing in single futon that can be folded into a seat or opened out into a lounge bed.</p><p>Moving on to the balcony that may be a part of your kitchen, nothing beats starting a small vegetable garden here, complete with a little seating space for your tea breaks. Considering installing open shelves on the walls to hold your plants. You could also have ceiling hooks to hold suspended pots at varying heights. Grow your family’s basic needs and have the pleasure of going from farm to fork at your meals. </p><p>For the balcony that is attached to your children’s room, you may want to consider raising the height of the railings a bit more than the usual. Alternately, you could have a decorative safety grill set up. Make this a space for your children to hang out in. Put in a colorful bean bag. Install a small basketball net on the wall. If space permits consider a swing. Children never get too old for swings. </p><p>And for the balcony that is attached to your bedroom, there are so many things that you can do. Enclosing the space with sliding windows will give you flexibility creating interesting nooks, without having to worry about the elements.</p><p>This becomes a space that can be made into a reading corner with wall mounted shelves. It can be your own private little gym. It can also hold a small work space for where you can get things done. Alternately it can serve as an extension to your bedroom with a comfortable seating space, done up with a bit of greenery and even a water body to boot.</p><p><b>Decking up Your Lawn</b></p><p>If you have a lawn in your home then this is an area that you will want to decorate as well. Let’s start with furniture options. When choosing your outdoor furniture, it is important to have something that is appropriate for the kind of weather you have. At the very least this furniture will have to be treated to handle all kinds of weather. Invest in a canopied swing for your lawn. Nothing can beat settling down with a book in the comfort and safety of your own home and lawn. </p><p>In terms of landscaping, go with options that are based on how much of maintenance you are willing to undertake. There are a range of hardy, flowering plants that you can introduce. Bring in at least one tree that will grow big and provide your family shade. Consider a water body as well and even combine it with a rock garden. </p><p>There is just so much you can do with your balcony and your lawn as long as you work with your designer and understand the needs of your family well.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> Every once in a while we would all like to see a change in our interiors. Here are the top 5 picks on what you can do for your home this time. </p><p>The weather has not been treating us too well this year and we are now at the cusp of a change in climate. With the summer gradually winding up and the skies overcast on most evenings, you know it’s almost time for the monsoons to get here. It is also a great time of the year to consider upgrading the look of your home a bit. Nothing as drastic as a makeover, but a few small changes to your décor can help you bring in some change. Here are our top 5 picks for you to consider: </p><p><b>A Foyer Unit: </b>With a change of seasons comes a change in things that you carry with you and even wear. A new foyer unit will ensure that none of those muddy shoes make it past the foyer threshold. If you choose to pick the Ivy Foyer Unit, you will have a neat space to stash away those rain shoes as well as drawers to hold umbrellas and raincoats. Not to mention the fact that you also have a great décor element in your foyer that you can deck up in multiple ways. </p><p><b>An Entertainment Unit:  </b> With the rains soon going to hit us, a lot of our entertainment for the weekend is now going to move indoors. This would be the perfect time to consider the Skylar Entertainment unit. This unit combines that best of a floating shelf to hold your TV, complete with drawer space for your movie CDs. Surrounding this is an L-shaped display rack divided into square shelves and a single vertical display space.</p><p>Not only do these shelves work to hold your music system, speakers and CDs, but a range of knick-knacks and souvenirs as well. In fact the top of this shelf can even be given a green cover with some indoor plants. Entertainment indoors never looked this good.</p><p><b>A Kitchen Makeover: </b>If you are looking at a big ticket change to the way your home looks, consider investing in an Eagle L-shaped modular kitchen. While this kitchen effectively gives your space a stylish facelift, what it also does is make way for a seating area within the kitchen. This can be an independent unit or can even be customized for you to include a dining peninsula. This kitchen completely takes care of your storage needs and gives you a neatly segregated space to prep, clean and cook. Need we say more! </p><p><b>A Brand New Wardrobe:  </b>No we don’t mean you head out and purchase a completely new set of clothing (though that is a great idea for the décor change that we are suggesting). Most of us tend to have different sets of clothes every season. If you are considering making a wardrobe change, you may want to do that literally as well. The Dove Wardrobe is an elegant set of cupboards that gives you ample space to store things vertically or horizontally. The overhead cabinets give you space for your lesser used clothing items like your woolens and even your curtains and rugs. This wardrobe makes a great addition to every home and frees up floor space in your bedroom as well. </p><p><b>Time to Dust off those Books: </b> What better than the onset of the rains to get back to reading your favorite books. And with that, you will want to bring in a new bookcase. Consider the Oilcloth Bookcase that is split into two columns of open storage space. While your regular sized books will easily fit in, this is one that also accommodates those oddly sized coffee table books as well. Add some personal touches with decorative book ends and you will have a book case that will soon be a talking point. The shelf is rather flexible and can be placed just about anywhere in the house and still look fabulous. </p><p>These are 5 great additions you can make to the décor of your home this change of season. While changing the look of your interiors it also helps you reconnect with some interesting facets of your life. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> The foyer unit is an integral part of the décor of your foyer. This space has myriad ways in which it can be done up. </p><p>There was a time when the foyer was practically designed out of every home and apartment with the notion of it being unnecessary. But this space, which was once part of a traditional home, has now made a comeback in most residential spaces. </p><p>The foyer is that space that provides you with a connection between the outside world and the inside of your home. Once considered a waste of floor space, today, it is an integral part of a home; a point of relief where one is introduced to the interiors of your home. The foyer has grown to serve different purposes, primarily that being:</p><p><b>Sets Tone for Interiors: </b> When you open your main door and invite visitors into your home, the foyer acts as the perfect welcome spot. Simple illumination and flower décor is enough to create a great impression even before a person has stepped in. Many times, you may have visitors who come in to drop off or collect something. The foyer is a great space for them to wait. In short, your foyer is a space that makes a great first impression.  </p><p><b>Storage Space:  </b>The foyer is also a great area to create a smart storage space. From shoes to coats and jackets and even to smaller items like your keys and umbrellas, a foyer unit in this space does just the trick. Add in a fancy mirror and it also becomes a great point for that last look at yourself before you step out, or as you step in. </p<p><b>How to Use Your Foyer Unit: </b>No matter what the size of your foyer, you will be able to do it up in a great way. The idea is to introduce a bit of décor, storage and seating to complete it. Foyer units are able to provide you with these requirements instantly. </p><p>Take for example the <b>Jade Foyer Unit.</b> This compact closed shelving unit allows you to store shoes on the inside. The top can be done up with a cushion or two to make for small seating when you are wearing your shoes. Alternatively, you could place small wooden or cane stools on either side of the unit to provide the seating. On the top instead, you may consider placing a simple vase of flowers and decorative bowls for your keys and smaller knick-knacks. You may even consider a fish bowl here for a nice, friendly look.</p><p>If you have the space to accommodate a larger unit such as the 2-drawer, double shelf <b>Emerald Foyer Unit</b> you may try something more. The shelves and the drawers take care of all your storage needs in terms of shoes, umbrellas and smaller accessories. On the wall above, you could consider mounting a series of wicker baskets to hold your jackets and caps. If you have another wall free, consider a mirror there, after all, who doesn’t like to look at themselves.</p><p>The tops of your foyer units can be styled into seating areas with cushions. These may be placed on the foyer unit or may even be embedded into the wall. Alternately the top of the foyer unit may also be decorated with indoor plants. A selection of bonsais or miniature gardens or even terrariums will go really well here.</p><p>The foyer is also a great place to introduce some floating shelves for little mementoes to do up the space. You may even consider bringing in wall mounted aquariums or vertical indoor gardens. This of course depends on the space you have.</p><p>There are few things that you have to keep in mind when doing up your foyer:</p><ul><li>Remember to include only as much furniture are proportionately necessary for the space that you have. </li><li>Always remember to bring in storage, décor and seating in your foyer to make the most use of it.</li><li>When working on the décor and color scheme, ensure that it connects to the interiors of your living room that will come right after. </li></ul><p>A foyer unit can be your main element of décor around which you can build the rest of the look as you please. Work with your designer to get the best foyer space possible.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> Kitchen hacks are useful tips that have emerged from the need for a quick and effective solution. There are so many such hacks that will make your kitchen a fun place to be in. </p><p>The kitchen is often touted as a place of happiness. A place where you not only cook and entertain but also spend time with friends and family. And only those who spend time in the kitchen will know what it takes to make the place an efficient one. If you are working your way to being a kitchen ninja, here are some hacks that may really help you get there faster. </p><p>These are simple problems you may be facing every day and some solutions to them:</p><ul><li>Does your cutting board tend to have a mind of its own? Each time you find yourself struggling to hold the board in place because it keeps moving around? Well, this is quite common with boards that have a smooth bottom surface. The simplest way to handle this is to dampen a kitchen napkin or a cotton towel and place it on your platform. Over this, you place your cutting board. Rest assured it won’t move an inch. </li><li>Are you knives never as sharp as you would like them to be? The quickest hack to sharpening your knives when you do not have a sharpening block handy, is to turn over a ceramic mug and use the rough portion of the base. Sharpen your knives on this edge just the way you would use a block. Also, make sure to store your knives in a block or on a magnetic strip, to ensure that they stay sharp</li><li>Do you have a tendency to boil milk or pasta or some vegetable, leave it unattended, only to come back to a complete mess? Well, placing a wooden spoon across your boiling vessel, will help make sure that the mess does not happen. This is because the wood acts as a repellent to the bubbles that form in the liquid. Since the bubbles are filled with steam, they burst when they come in contact with a spoon. This hack, however is good only till the time the wooden spoon is not overheated or wet. Then, you end up with a mess on your hands again. Place the spoon only if you are not going to be around to keep an eye on it for a short time. </li><li>Almost all of us have ended up with stale bread at some point or the other. While you could consider making a bread pudding out of it, there are other things that you can do. Starting with actually reviving your bread. If you have a half-eaten loaf of bread, run it under some water with the sliced side facing down. Now wrap this in silver foil and heat in your oven till the water is absorbed and the bread is back to its original fresh self. With stale slices, you can toast them till hard, make bread crumbs and store for future use. </li><li>Slicing onions can bring the best of us to our knees. The tears are sometimes unbearable. You may be used to soaking peeled onions in some water before cutting them. Some alternates are – placing a piece of bread in your mouth when you cut onions. The bread stops sulfur gas, which emanates from onions when they are cut, from getting into your system and causing tears. Placing them in ice water slows down the enzymes that cause tears, making them easier to cut too. </li><li>Peeled a lot of garlic for a pickle or for a party dip and have the smell of garlic lingering on your hands? That is common enough. What you can do is take a stainless steel spoon or vessel and rub this against your hands and fingers vigorously under cold water. The smell-causing ions of garlic cling on to the ions of stainless steel, thus coming off your hands. The cold water helps close your pores squeezing out any residual oils. </li><li>Decided to go all fancy for a party and brought in a large number of cherry tomatoes and are now stuck with slicing through those? An easy way to do this is the place them all on a plate. Put another plate on top of them and gently bear down to hold them in place. Use a serrated knife and slice through from one end of the plate. You will have neatly sliced tomatoes in one go.</li><li>Notice how sometimes the smell of food lingers in your microwave or your fridge. To get rid of these smells, put in a bowl of white vinegar in the place. If you don’t have this on hand, a bowl of baking soda or leftover coffee grounds will do just the job. </li></ul><p>These are some simple kitchen hacks that will make life in the kitchen much easier. Over time, you will develop a few of your own hacks to getting things done better in your kitchen</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> Curtains add character to your room, while enhancing its overall look. These pointers will help you make the right choices when it comes to selecting curtains and drapes. </p><p>When planning the perfect home décor, your windows and their treatment will find a prominent place in your to-do list. Curtains and drapes are important décor accessories and it will help to have a plan of action in place, to make the right choices. Here are some aspects that you will need to think of when choosing your curtains. </p><p><b>Finalizing Window Frames:</b> Most of us are excited about the prospect of going out shopping for curtains. In the bargain we often tend to forget the basics, that of window treatments. The window frame is your first consideration when choosing curtains. How would you like they displayed? You may choose to go with standard frames easily available in stores, or opt for customised versions. Where you place your curtain brackets will change the way your curtains look. </p><p>Plain window frames can have the brackets placed on the wall above, allowing for a nice, long flow. This also gives the illusion of a taller frame. Extending the rods on either side of the frame, gives a grand look to your space.</p><p><b>Choose your Curtains:</b>  Once you have the window frames settled on, it is now time to select your curtains. Here are some points to keep in mind:</p><ul><li><b>Give Each Room an Identity:</b> For the sake of budget or thanks to common misconception, most people tend to have similar curtains for each of their rooms. There is no unsaid rule about having the same curtains in every room. Let each room speak for itself and allow each room to develop its own character. Choose your curtains and the way you want it displayed, based on the room and the kind of ambience you are creating.</li><li><b>Colour Choices:</b> There are so many ways you can go with this too. While on one hand curtains act as an extension of a room, they need not necessarily mean having the same colours as your walls. Work with hues and contrasts to give your room an additional layer of beauty. If you would rather have sober colours through the space, consider tone-on-tone colour combinations that work with neutral hues of the same shade. </li><li><b>Privacy or Views or Both:</b> Curtains serve a dual purpose – they provide beauty and shade, while also ensuring privacy. Based on the room you plan to decorate, make your choice of sheer or thick curtains according to your usage of the space. This is the point at which you will have to look into fabric and weave to make the right choice. In places where you would like dual advantage, you could consider layering sheer and thick curtains to be used as needed. In fact, this is also a great way to improve insulation from cold and heat inside your home.</li><li><b>Textures and Patterns:</b> If you are looking at a change of curtains or want to add in a level of dynamism to your room, then textured or patterned curtains may be just what you are looking for.  A velvet-like texture or a geometric coloured pattern on your curtains can infuse vibrancy into a room. </li><li><b>Length and Lining Requirements:</b> There are a few things you need to remember when measuring out your curtain length. It should be measured based on the height of your curtain rods and the length you want displayed. You may want additional material for tab tops. Always add in a little more material to allow for shrinkage. A smart tip would be to purchase a small, extra length of curtain material to help with any patch work you may have to do in the future.</li></ul><p><b>Displaying Your Curtains:</b> You may choose to go with the regular heading with hooks, which is the most common. Another form of display would be the rod pocket, where a tunnel of sorts is created with the curtain material and the rod run through it. You can also have a pleated heading, with narrow, wide or even flat and box pleats. Tab Top headings allow you to have delicate folds of cloth over the curtain giving it a delicate touch and more homely feel.</p><p>Curtains and window treatments are an extension of wall décor and you will want to keep these tips in mind when making a choice. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b>There are a few small things that you can do to bring down the age of your home and the rooms within it. Here are a set of tips that can be applied to just about any home and décor. </p><p>It was really exciting coming to your new home and take in a space that is freshly done up. Over the years, your home has developed that lived-in look, which is great, but which you will soon tire of. This does not mean that you completely overhaul the look of your home. There are quite a few <b>styling tips </b>that you can incorporate into your home to reduce its age and give it a fresh new look. Before you start to work on any room, it is important that you first de-clutter your space completely. This alone brings new life to a space. Let’s take a look at it room-wise:</p><p><b>The Living Room: </b> One of the easiest ways to brighten up a dull living room is to give it a fresh coat of paint. If you have already used a fancy colour palette, and textured paints, you may want to consider the likes of wallpapers for a home. A simple colour palette of no more than two neutral colours will give you a wonderful backdrop for your furniture. In fact, the room will be completely fresh and new. </p><p>Change the layout of your furniture a bit. Bring in a few small elements like a new rug or a change in lamp shades, or a fresh set of curtains. Even such minor changes can<b>The Bedroom:</b> This is a personal space in your house where you usually tend to let go of all inhibitions. As a result, the space can become cluttered and look dated after a short while. Once you are done de-cluttering your space you can think of investing in a new set of soft furnishing for the room. This can be sheer curtains under heavy drapes, an upholstered chair and fancy set of bed spreads and cushions among other things. If you have been storing all your toiletries and make-up on the bathroom shelf, now would be a good time to bring in a dressing table and set it up. Create a reading corner with the upholstered chair and affix floating shelves for books or knick-knacks. All of this is bound to bring life to your room. </p><p><b> The Kitchen:</b> This is a space that is used by the whole family and thus becomes a high maintenance area. Once you are done with a thorough de-clutter and cleaning of your kitchen, you will need to step back and see how it needs a change. One of the best ways to infuse fresh life into your kitchen is to invest in stainless steel bodied equipment. These can be given a quick shine and instantly brighten up your kitchen. Introduce a few potted hardy plants on the top of your kitchen cabinets to brighten up an otherwise dull space. Give your kitchen tiles on the floor and the walls a good scrub and a touch of varnish to make them as good as new. Step back again to find years shaved off your kitchen.</p><p><b>The Front Door: </b>Now many times, in the effort to make your house look good on the inside, you tend to forget what is there on the outside. The outside of your home is where first impressions are made. Start by stepping out and taking a few steps away. Look at your entryway from afar and take stock of how it looks. Clear up the walkway to your front door. .</p><p>Place a few blooming plants around it. Install a nice knocker on your door or a fancy name plate on the door to add to its personality and character. Stand at a distance and look into your home from an open door and take in what can be seen. You will be amazed at the kind of clutter you may see. Clear up the space to make the inside of your home look great from the outside. </p><p>These are some of the ways in which to make your home look young and rejuvenated despite of the years it may have behind. Each time you give your home a new look make sure that you create a base for a change in looks over a short period of time. Neutral backgrounds, furniture that can be moved around, contrasting sets of soft furnishing can all bring about a sizable change in looks and age of a place.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b>Feng Shui is an ancient Chinese form that allows for the free flow of good energy or Chi as it is known. There are several ways in which you can introduce this in your homes.</p><p>Feng Shui (pronounced Fung Shuway) is an ancient Chinese form that aims to bring harmony of energies in your home. The form is based on philosophy that has come down through the centuries and is culturally neutral. This means that Feng Shui has found a place in modern day homes. If you are interested in bringing in Feng Shui into your home, here are some basics for you to understand and some ways in which to go about it.</p><p><b>Doorways and More:</b> Your front door is your main entryway into your home. Feng Shui places strong emphasis on making this friendly and welcoming. How do you do that? For starters, clear up any clutter that may be present on the inside and outside of the door. Once done, line up the entryway with potted flowering plants that look pleasant and inviting. Ensure that your door has no squeaks and creaks. Oil your hinges to ensure the door opens smoothly. The noises of a door stay with you subconsciously when you move in and out of the house, creating an unpleasant feeling. Place a mirror directly overlooking the main entryway. This will allow for light to be reflected into your home, bringing in the energy.</p><p>If you would like to bring in a few Feng Shui artefacts, consider the Money Frog who can be placed on the right corner, behind your door, on the floor. This is believed to help bring and retain wealth in the home. </p><p>Feng Shui also suggests that you always use your front door as an entryway. Many homes have a garage that leads to the house. Convenience makes this entry the most popular. Feng Shui suggests you avoid it. </p><p><b>Identify your Baguas:</b> Identify the Bagua or the main areas of your home that affect your life. The kind of Feng Shui you bring into your home must be based on this. As a general rule-of-thumb, the Southeast section of your home is believed to be related to the flow of money energy. The north is related to your career, the south to fame and reputation, east to health and so on. Based on these characteristics of your home, you will able to work on various elements of Feng Shui and bring home the right mix.</p><p>Your Feng Shui can also be based on 5 elements of wood, fire, earth, metal and water. These can be represented by specific colors and healthy mix of them is what will assure you a good flow of energy in your home.</p><p><b>Furniture Placement:</b> No matter what your room, the way you place your furniture will determine the flow of energy in a room. For starters do not place them facing your entryway directly. Arrange furniture in such a way that you have a clear view of the entry way without facing it directly. This especially pertains to reading chairs, working tables and other such places that you spend a lot of time in. The idea is to have a bird’s eye view of the room you are in, when seated or lying down in your favorite corner. </p><p>Also make sure to always have enough of natural light and ventilation come into your home to bring in the good energy. Introduce oxygenating plants that bring in fresh air into your home.</p><p><b>Simple Feng Shui Methods:</b> There are some simple things you can do to improve the flow of energy in your home. For starters, always make sure to keep your bathroom/toilet door closed. It is believed that negative energy emanated in these rooms can permeate the whole house. Keep the doors closed, especially when you have an en-suite bedroom or a common bathroom facing a living room, as is common in India.</p><p>If the top of your kitchen cabinets are empty, this can result in a lot of negative energy being stored there. To combat that, you can place a few cabinet lights, and then some terrarium or open potted plants to absorb all the negative energy and create some good chi.</p><p>The placement of your bed also make a world of difference – ideally place your bed diagonally across you bedroom room. This means that you can be placed with a clear view of the door, yet not directly in front of it. </p><p>These are just some of the ways in which you can introduce Feng Shui into your home. Start with the basics and then move into the more in-depth versions of the form. The difference in ambience is quite palpable.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b>The open kitchen is a wonderful concept that allows you freedom of interaction with guests and more floor space to boot. However, you may want to consider the long term implications of such a space. </p><p>The kitchen has long since graduated from being just a place where all things good for the tummy originate from. The kitchen, once considered the domain of the matriarch of the family, is today a place for family and friends to commune. Among the several floor plans available for modular kitchens today, the open kitchen is one that has been gaining immense popularity. </p><p>It allows for the kitchen to become an interactive and social space and does not isolate the kitchen user from the rest of the family. However, the open kitchen plan is still a matter of choice and its presence in a home needs to be evaluated, before it is actually implemented. Here are a few perspectives for you to contemplate on before considering an open kitchen.</p><p><b>Why the Open Kitchen Came About?</b></p><p>The modular kitchen is not partitioned to be a separate room but rather is accessible from multiple points in a home. It is also a room that is clearly visible and heard to a large extent. Open kitchens came about with the advent of studio apartments, in a bid to make the best use of limited space. In average size apartments today, the concept is used to provide you with more floor space to work with. The only base requirement for an open kitchen plan is to have a ceiling that is high enough to ensure proper ventilation. Your designer will be able to evaluate your space and let you know if it is a workable idea. </p><p>If your home and requirements for floor space match these basic ideas, the open kitchen may be something you want to consider for your home.</p><p><b>What Kind of User Best Suits an Open Kitchen?</b></p><p>One of the main considerations for an open kitchen is the kind of person who is going to use it the most. For those members of the family that cook, here two major questions to be answered:</p><p><b>The kind of person using the kitchen: </b>What is the personality of the person who will be using the kitchen the most? Do they prefer solitude when cooking? Do they like to cook in bulk? Are they loud, noisy and messy? If yes, then the open kitchen is not the kind of space you want. If you have an older person using the kitchen, they may not like the idea of being on display when in the kitchen. </p><p>On the other hand, a working mum, who likes to keep an eye on her children when in the kitchen would appreciate this place. A young couple who love to have friends over would like a space where they can interact with guests while cooking for them. </p><p><b>The Kind of Cooking: </b>Since the idea of an open kitchen came with the studio apartment, the idea has always been for it to cater for a small family. That being said, this floor plan has also been incorporated into homes that have larger spaces and families. If the cooking is not going to be literally round-the-clock as needed for a large family, then an open kitchen will work. Nuclear families work better out of an open kitchen than larger ones. </p><p><b>Think of your Kitchen in the Long Term</b></p><p>The idea of having an open kitchen is a wonderful one, but a concept that needs a little forward thinking as well. While entertaining in the kitchen may be something you see yourself doing often, you may not always want to have guests peering over your shoulders. While it works great for friends, when you have business partners and bosses over, you don’t want them to see you sweating it out in the kitchen.</p><p>Similarly, as your children grow up, they will have friends over and will not always appreciate the fact that you can look over them from the kitchen.</p><p>Cooking up a surprise for your partner will also become a difficult prospect when you have an open kitchen. How are you going to hide that gorgeous cake you have baked when he or she is right across in the living room?</p><p>These are some of the thoughts you must keep in mind when considering an open kitchen for your home. While the idea is a great one, there are certain fundamental criteria that need to fall in place for it to work well. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b>Changing the way your living room décor looks can be as simple and inexpensive as adding in an element or two. Here are some ideas on how to go about it.</p><p>So you think it is time that your living room sees a change. However, your bank balance does not think that is a good idea. Fear not! You can give your living room a whole new look on a budget that will make you smile.</p><p>As with any such project that involves a change in the way a space looks, the first thing is to de-clutter. Take a step away from your living room and assess all the spots where there is a tendency for clutter to build-up. Notice how one of your chairs will be the family dump yard. From bags, books and files to jackets, personal technology and more, there will be that one chair in the living room that takes it all. You will also notice how your reading material, in the form of newspapers and magazines, tends to pile up in one corner as well.</p><p>Work on clearing up all the clutter on every surface and ensure that each item has a designated spot. Make sure that every member of the family is held responsible to see that their things are returned to the right places. </p><p><b>Wall Effects</b></p><p>Once you are done with that, you can take a step back again and now assess what needs to be done to your room. Often, most we tend to forget about our walls. Large spaces remain completely devoid of anything. This is the best place to start. Think large canvases that take up majority of the wall space that you have. Invest in one or two canvases or paintings with completely different colour schemes. This will give you a way of changing looks repeatedly without breaking the bank. </p><p>If paintings are not really your thing, you could consider placing large rugs on the wall. There is no hard and fast rule about having these on the floor alone. Alternately, a large blank wall can be filled with a delicate curtain hanging off a curtain rod. This creates a sense of curiosity and a talking point, while filling up a blank space completely. A simple way of giving your hall an inexpensive décor element. </p><p><b>Showcasing Your Décor</b></p><p>If you do not have a showcase for the lack of space in your living room, here is a great idea that will work for you inexpensively. Invest in a set of stackable box shelves and place them over each other to create an even top. This becomes a great side table and also serves as a means of showcasing your knick knacks. Place a table lamp on the flat surface. Use one of the boxes for magazines and newspapers, another for artefacts. You can even fit one of the boxes with charging cables and have a nice place for the family’s personal technology.</p><p><b>Take Care of Awkward, Dull Corners</b></p><p>Most living rooms invariably end up with a dark, dull corner that does not have a décor element going for it. If this dull corner is above a seating nook, then a bright arrangement of show plates on the wall will do just the trick. If this is space is something that is created behind a seating arrangement, you could consider filling in the gap with a free standing tall lamp with an interesting shade. </p><p>If the space is on the ground, then perhaps a low-profile seating spot with a rug and throw pillows can be created. You will be surprised at how much the members of your family will take to this spot. In fact, even guests will enjoy this nook. You can brighten it up even further with a table lamp that is placed on the floor will be a great addition.</p><p><b>Adding in Interesting Elements</b></p><p>Sometimes, all you need to give your home a quick visual makeover are some interesting elements. For a side table that is going empty, arrange multi-height candle holders and light them up in the evenings. If you have children in the house, a safer option would be a thematic flowering pot or indoor plant. In your showcase, rather than simply stacking crockery and artefacts, create arrangements that add an element of interest. You can move things around regularly to achieve different looks.</p><p>Go with the unusual. Place a vertical garden on your walls. Or bring in a wall mounted aquarium. Any one of these elements will add a texture to your décor and become a talking point.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b>Building up a pantry is about assessing the needs of your family and then creating a personal store of products that ensures you a good number of home cooked meals regularly.  </p><p>No matter how much we experiment with eating out, there is no denying how wonderful a home cooked meal can be. If you want to place some good meals before your family every day, the first step is to create and stock a pantry of supplies. Here are some steps to get the perfect pantry for your home.</p><p><b>Setting up Your Pantry</b></p><p>To create a pantry, you first need the space for storage. In any kitchen, no matter what the size, this can always be a dicey affair. You can begin with a small closet and add in some more shelves. Short shelves should do just the trick in storing boxes of ingredients and jars. If you have additional floor space, you can consider adding in bins to store bags of snacks and food items that have a longer shelf life. </p><p>To help keep a track of the products you have, it is best to have all your products on display on the shelves. Make sure everything is visible. This will give you a good idea on what you can use for your next meal. It will also help you prepare lists to replenish your stocks. And the other advantage is that since your shelves are clearly visible, you will be forced to keep everything clean and organized. </p><p>Strategic storing is another great idea to keep in mind when working on a pantry. Keep similar items together. Alternately, you could consider keeping the base ingredients of commonly made sauces or curries in a shelf together. This makes thinking of a meal a much quicker process.  </p><p>To increase the space in your pantry, you should consider using your doors as well. Add in a layer as suspended shelves. Alternately, you could create sheet of broad pouches that can be hooked onto the back of the door and used for storage as well. The hierarchy of storage can be based on your usage of the products being stowed away.</p><p>If you are using drawers in your pantry, ensure that everything you have in it has a label on the lid. This will help you pick things easily. You must remember to stack in order of expiry so that you unnecessarily do not lose out on some good products or produce. </p><p><b>Stocking Your Pantry  </b></p><p>Now that you have the space for a pantry, the next step is to begin stocking it. There are multiple approaches to this as well. Let’s look at some of them:</p><p><b>The Apocalypse Storage: </b>Your selection of food products must be those that can be stored for years at a stretch without going bad. These could be ready to eat or heat and eat foods with a very long shelf life. You could every buy grain, pulses and rice in bulk. Also plan to add freeze dried food that will last you a long time and ensures a good meal should there actually be a disaster.</p><p><b>The Seasonal Pantry:  </b>Now this a pantry that will be work in progress for a long while. With each season comes some lovely fruit and vegetables. You can choose to preserve, jam or pickle produce in various ways for you to enjoy through the year. These can also be processed to an extent to help create the base of a dish and stored in your pantry as well. At the end of every season, take a stock of what you have in your pantry and you will be amazed at the number of wholesome meals you will be able to come up with. </p><p><b>The Bargain Special:  </b>Every once in a while comes an interesting set of bargains that you just cannot pass up. This is especially with staples of grains, pulses and other essentials like oils, sugar, salt and pasta. When you stock up with these products, ensure that you have the space as well as the right medium of storage handy for each one of them. It would be a pity to lose out of good quality produce because you have not stored it the right way.  </p><p>With these main pantry formats as the base idea you can create a pantry of your own based on your family’s personal needs. Ensure that everything is well labeled and arranged in order of its expiration dates. This will reduce wastage to a large extent. </p><p>Building up a pantry is an easy task that you must work on slowly but surely. You will be pleased with the number of homemade, healthy meals you will be able to turn out for your family from here.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> A color scheme for your kitchen is based equally on your personal color choices and the layout of your kitchen. </p><p>The kitchen is a place that you will spend a considerable amount of time in. Today, it has become a more social place and you will want the décor to be more inviting to your friends and family. It all begins with the right color scheme. Keep in mind that there is no good or bad color scheme. It is basically about how you choose to use a particular set of colors in the scheme of things. So how do you come up with a color palette that makes sense for your space? Here are some tips that may help. </p><p><b>Know the Color Schemes Available</b></p><p>Thanks to technology, there is a wide spectrum of colors available in the market today. Shades of your favorite color can be manufactured as well, making just about any hue possible. To work towards a color palette, you need to understand the various kinds there are:</p><p><b>Warm Palette: </b>This is characterized by bright and bold colors such as oranges, purples and red. This is range that can easily get out of hand if right choices are not made. The best way to approach such a combination of colors is to match analogous colors or those that are placed next to each other on the color wheel. You will be able to find those that can be matched easily. This is a selection of colors that is ideal for a space where you entertain a lot of friends and family. </p><p><b>Cool Palette:  </b> These colors are also best chosen based on analogous color placements. They are bold but on the lighter side. You will find lighter shades of blue, olive and cream as a part of this palette. </p><p><b>Bold Palette: </b>Not necessarily a contemporary approach to kitchen paints, the bold palette brings in a traditional look. It makes use of eye-catching splashes of color that are otherwise incorporated into a dark background. While you may have dark wooden cabinets and light natural floral colored backsplashes, the bold palette brings in a sudden touch of color</p><p><b>Traditional Kitchen Palette:  </b>Then you have the warm palette that is all about creating an intimate and warm space for you and the family. It invites you to come in and savor all the delicacies that you prepare. A smart mix of browns, reds, creams and silvers will do the trick. </p><p><b>How to Use these Colors  </b></p><p>One of the best ways to use bold colors in your kitchen to keep your large elements such as the counter-tops, the cabinet facades and the flooring in neutral shades. Use the bold colors of your choice on walls, backsplashes and in the form of accents. A bright red oven range or brightly colored windows can make your kitchen really stand out.</p><p>If you are still confused about pairing of colors, here are a few combinations you may like. </p><p><b>Ice blue, white and grey: </b>This combination works really well for kitchens that have a lot of natural light coming in. You could have white cabinetry and ceiling to begin with. This gives you a sense of openness. Bring in a white marble slab over ice blue drawers with metal handles. You create a backsplash of grey tiles that will instantly break any monotony of color that may be there.  </p><p><b>Light green, white and dark brown: </b>This is a color combination that gives you a great mix of the new and old. You can give your kitchen a rugged look with distressed wooden cabinets lined up against a light green wall. The natural light that comes into the room will give it an added character with the light bouncing off it. Having white paneled walls will create that perfect break between the darker shade of wood on the walls and the ceiling. </p><p><b>Hardwood and White:</b> Another great combination is to introduce hardwood floors in a white kitchen. This makes for an interesting combination with modern day stainless steel appliances. Introducing steel handles on the cabinetry will bring the whole place together. If the ceiling height allows you, consider bringing in small chandelier to brighten up the space.</p><p>When choosing your colors, here are some tips to keep in mind</p><ul><li>Always pick colors that you have an emotional connect to. Picking something that looks good in a magazine photo does not necessarily mean it will work for you and your tastes.</li><li>Do not worry about a paint color being too bright. In the case of a kitchen, the cabinetry and appliances take up so much real estate, your bright color will not stick out like a sore thumb.</li><li>Do not be rigid in your choice of colors. When working with your designer you may realize that the particular scheme you had in mind does not work. Be ready to try something new.</li></ul><p>With these tips and general understanding of how colors will work in your kitchen, you are now ready to create a color palette for your personal space.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> Home automation is a relatively old concept that sees new innovations all the time. Here is a collection of interesting smart gadgets to change the way you interact with your home. </p><p>We live in times when technology and the Internet are integral parts of our lives. The effort of what we do in everyday life has been significantly reduced thanks to some really <b>smart gadgets</b> that have been developed for homes. If you are looking to upgrade your quality of living with some unique innovations in technology, here are some <b>smart gadgets</b> that you must think of investing in. </p><b>The Television Set: </b> Let’s start with the most common of gadgets in everyone’s home – the TV set. Gone are the days of box screen, flat screens, LDs and now, gradually, the HDTV standalone sets. TVs have gone designer with brands such as NOTAM, actually designing TVs to match the décor of your home and living room. This is in relation to size, placement, wall mounts and even colour palettes. The TV screens are now advanced to providing a full HD experiences, be controlled by an RF remote and easily be incorporated into a home automation set up. </p><p><b>The Lighting Systems:  </b>The simplest form of home automation in lighting set-ups has been the dimmer. Taking this leaps ahead is a new age system of lighting that solves one fundamental problem – finding the light switch in the dark. Today companies such as CareGlow have created motion sensor detection switches that turn lights on when they sense someone in the room. You may have seen this technology in high-end hotels and their restrooms. It is now available for homes as well and is a boon to those who have senior citizens and children in the house. It also ensures a certain level of safety when entering a dark room. </p><p><b>Take your Entertainment Everywhere: </b>So you have an HDR set top box that pauses and records all your favourite shows. But what if you did not have to pause your entertainment just because you are taking a long shower. Technology today has brought about the bathroom mirror which has a built-in TFT screen that allows you to watch your favourite shows no matter which room you are in. When not in use, it functions as a mirror and who doesn’t like to preen a bit. </p><p><b>Central Storage Systems: </b>With every member of the house now having personal technology of their own in the form of tablets, laptops and smart phones, the WiFi router has become passé in every household. The need for a centralized storage system is but natural. It would be a good idea to invest in 1 or 2TB home network storage system to ensure that the whole family has their data secure. These systems are able to process and hold data from both Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. There are several upgrades that you will be able to introduce based on your specific needs. </p><p><b>Robotic Security Camera: </b>A webcam attached to a moving robot that goes from one room to another keeping an eye on things as part of your <b>security tools</b> sounds cool doesn’t it. Now this is no longer something that you see only in the movies. Ideal for homes that have multi-levels or where there is a home office that may be isolated. You can keep an eye on your family no matter where in the house you are. The robot may be connected via the Internet and can be remotely commanded to go back to its charging station when needed. </p><p><b>The Universal Remote: </b>One of the most prized technological gadgets for any home is the universal remote that gives you a single access point to all the electronics in your home. Logitech has a quality model that you could consider investing. This remote can be used to virtually connect up to 15 separate audio, video as well as gaming consoles. It supports close to 5000 brands. </p><p><b>Keyless Door Locks:</b> Go completely hi-tech with keyless door lock systems that can be triggered to open on fingerprint recognition or retina recognition. These can keep your home safe, especially if you have multiple entry points. These devices have been created to be integrated into manual systems of locking where needed and can be remotely accessed and connected to at all times. </p><p>These are just some of the interesting home automation gadgets that have come into the home décor scenario. Of course, they do come at a premium in terms of pricing, but then so does every quality product. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> French styled décor is a timeless form of designing that many of us would like to bring home. There are certain thoughts that you must keep in mind to make it work right for you. </p><p>If there is one thing the French have given us along with some great food, wine and fashion, it is an interesting sense of interior design. When looking for something contemporary yet stylish, a lot of people opt for French interiors designed for them. Here are some ideas for you to contemplate if you want to go the French way for your home. </p><p>French provincial or country style décor is among the most sought after interior styles internationally. It is characterized by:</p><ul><li>Furniture that is well-worn with a rustic look. If you are unable to get your hands on décor elements that are naturally so, there are several distressing techniques that can be used to achieve the look.  </li><li>The French color palette is often a reflection of its countryside and so you will have colors like yellow, lavender and green making an appearance in your homes. </li><li>Window treatments in the French style are rather heavy and layered. You will use materials like toile, along with heavy drapes across the likes of bay windows or ceiling-to-floor styled windows. </li><li>Curtain displays are usually elaborate with headings, the use of awnings and longer length of drapes. </li><li>The French also pay particular attention to their lighting elements and you will find chandeliers of different kinds, wrought iron lighting accessories, hanging lanterns and more featuring in rooms. </li></ul><p>With this as your base to work with, here are some French style décor ideas that you can incorporate into your home, with your designer’s help:</p><ul><li>In your living room, bring in a good collection of classic styled arm-chairs. Considering the average space a living room has, one or two such chairs would be the perfect number. On these chairs you have cushions with a delicate gold trimming that add a classy, glamorous touch. </li><li>When shopping for mirrors, whether to place over your mantle, in your bedroom or in the corridor leading to the front door, go in for gilded, ornate mirrors which, contrary to popular belief, give a nice informal French look to your place.</li><li>The French always have a central décor item that acts as a focal point in every room. An ornate clock, a lovely chandelier or a statement set of drapes.</li><li>In any room that you will need a table in consider bringing in the distressed wooden look. This could be for a side table in your living room, a dressing table in your bedroom, or even your dining table. The dining table can even have a distressed wood bench on either side to complete the look. Of course the market is replete with crockery and cutlery that will complement the table perfectly. This is an idea that you can use for your work desk in your home office as well.</li><li>For your soft furnishing of curtains, bedspreads and sofa backs, opt for those that are ornate. Layers of lace, intricate embroidery and delicate brocades are what you should be looking for. Do not overdo it in a room. In fact, choose to go with one or two elements per room and watch the space come to life. </li><li>If you would like to bring in some color in your home, then consider going with stripes and checks. These could be two-toned or in varying hues of the same color. Match your curtains to your lampshades, or your curtain awnings to your sofa backs. This will help bring some harmony to your entire décor scheme. </li></ul><p>The idea with French décor is to go subtle. There is a lot of thought that goes into setting up the look and design. However, the final look is always based on the subtle use of color and texture. Another important aspect about French décor is the emphasis on high-end accessories and brands when setting up your home. </p><p>Keeping these elements in mind, and working with your designer will help you create an amazing set of French interiors for the rooms of your home.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak</b>: A spare room may be converted into a range of interesting spaces depending on your needs and the area you have to work with. Allow the room to serve you to its full potential. </p><p>Many of us invest in large homes with the anticipation of needing the space sometime in the future. You may have several ideas on what can be done with the space but just never get about doing anything. If you are tired of waiting around and are ready to do up your extra room, here is where you can start. </p><p>As with any large project, it is important to analyse the space that you have. How much of it do you have to work with and how many people can it occupy? Does the space naturally lend itself to the creation of a particular kind of room? For example, a room with a good view can be a lounge area. A room facing the sun is a perfect home gym space. A home that overlooks your backyard can be a home office or your children’s play area. The options are limitless. Here is how you can work out each of these possibilities. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/spare_room1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Fun Room for Children</b>: This can be a room that may be utilized by the whole family. Especially if you have children in varying age groups, you may want to create a space where all of them can come and have some fun. The use of designated side tables and book shelves will give each a space of their own. Putting in a TV as well as a computer will help the older ones relax while giving the younger ones space to play with their toys on the play mat. The good thing about a room of this nature is that its décor may be changed periodically to keep up with the growing children using it. The only thing to ensure is that the play room is close enough for adults to supervise, while giving children the privacy they need. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.mygubbi.com/product-blunt-entertainment-unit\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/3.Blunt_Front_White_BrownOak.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p><p><b>Home Entertainment Room</b>: This is by far the most common element added to a home. However, it is the popular and with good reason. Setting up a home theatre system can bring the comfort of the movies to your own home. A room of this nature will have to be a slightly secluded part of the house to lend itself well to soundproofing. Ensure you have mood lighting set in to dim and brighten lights as needed. Placing comfortable lounge chairs or Lazy Boys with small tables nearby will take care of the seating arrangements. Invest in a good quality sound system as well. To make the space efficient invest in a small refrigerator as well. This will supplement your snacks counter amazingly well. </p><p><b>Game Room for Adults</b>: Even the grown-ups need to play. If you have no children at home, then your spare room can be converted into a game room for adults. Much like the home theatre space, you can work on the room to be a self –sufficient entertainment space. Install a gaming console with a large TV screen. Having a TV screen instead of a monitor works well when you want to watch those live games and matches. Bring in a Foosball or Table Tennis set up. Nothing can beat a friendly game of both. If you are more of the sit down and play kinds, set up a table close to a shelf, with a collection of good board games and cards close by. Again, a refreshment corner in this room will make it the ideal space. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/spare_room2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Gym</b>: At a time when everyone wants to remain in good shape and fit, a home-based gym would be a great way to use a spare room. This room should be ideally placed where you have a good view. Exercise alone can be monotonous and good view helps. You will need professionals coming and setting up the space and equipment. What would be ideal is to factor in a small showering unit in your home gym. Looking at how the plumbing lines pass through the room and consider having one accordingly. A healthy snacks corner will make it a great place to exercise. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/spare_room3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Home Office</b>: Today, telecommuting and freelance, home based professionals are in plenty. If you are one of them, you may want to create a space of your own to work out of and have meeting in as well. A spare room, with a good view or a more secluded placement, based on your choice, would be a great idea. Ensure the room has a lot of natural light and ventilation. Use side tables and shelves for your technology and books. A smart work desk with storage facilities is a must. Invest in setting up a simple kitchenette to serve coffee and snacks from during your meetings. Personalize the space to give you a comfortable zone to work from. </p><p>These are just some of the ways to use your spare room. Of course, based on your unique needs, there is so much more for you to consider. Work with your designer to get the most out of this space. </p>",

The surface does not stain, making maintenance easy. It is also heat-resistant which is ideal in any kitchen. It also sets the base to integrate prep sinks and washing sinks as well, giving your kitchen a uniform look. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/perfect_counter.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Engineered Quartz</b>: This is a material that is put together with multiple elements to create a strong, durable and non-porous countertop material. It has several environment-friendly attributes which makes it an excellent choice for a green home. Though an expensive material, it is an eco-friendly one allowing you to do your bit for nature. It comes in multiple colour options allowing you choices ranging from earthy tones to brighter ones. </p>",

Ever noticed how you have only a small work area in your kitchen when the design actually factored in a lot of space? These are common scenarios in most homes where tables tend to become dumping grounds for the whole family. Clutter tends to pile up when you do not have designated spots for your things and that of the family. Here is how you are some organizing tips to de-clutter your tables.  </p><p>The first step is to survey the tables and look at what seems to pile up on the tables. This will give you an idea of all the things that need designated spots and the culprits leaving them behind. Here is a look at some of the common table cluttering elements and what you can do with them. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.mygubbi.com/product-madagascar-sideboard\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/011_1800_Side_Open.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p><p><b>The Mail</b>: Though the world has moved online, a large number of our bills still comes in the form of paper. You will find these piled up on the table. Along with this, will be a set of your take-out menus, some stray pages from the children’s homework and even files containing documents from work. The dining table tends to become home for all of these papers, simply because of the easy access. </p><p>An ideal solution is to first segregate all your papers and look at what may be discontinued. Do your bit for nature and try to get all your bills online. This will reduce papers that come in. For those that will continue, have a designated filing system or a drawer in your side table that they may be placed in. Make it a point to drill the habit of putting away papers, into each member of the family. For the newspaper and magazines that come in, have a magazine rack in your living room. Ensure only current editions are in it. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.mygubbi.com/product-baya-u-shaped-kitchen\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/BAYA_U-Shaped_Kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p><p><b>The Work Area</b>: Almost every member of the family loves to use the kitchen table to do their work. This ranges from homework to projects to office work and then more. If you would like them to continue do the same, then give each member a designated shelf or drawer in your side table in the dining room to stow away all their stationary and belongings once they are done. If you would rather have the dining table used only for eating, then ensure that each member has a designated work station in their respective rooms or in a place they are comfortable. </p><p><a href=\"https://https://www.mygubbi.com/product-waxwing-sliding-wardrobe\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/2.Waxwing_int1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p><p><b>Jackets and Bags</b>: These are the two most popular things to find their way to a dining table. Jackets tend to get flung onto the backs of chairs and back packs get dumped on the table or the floor. From these tumble out lunch boxes, books, files and more. Create a space in your foyer for everyone’s bags and jackets. Instil in them the habit of placing their bags and jackets on shelves or hooks that you have here. This way they have all their things in one place, allowing them to pick up and drop it as they enter and leave the house. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.mygubbi.com/product-botho-side-table\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/1.Botho_front_brownoak.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p><p><b>Electronic devices</b>: The bane of modern day homes is finding everyone’s personal technology stashed on the table. From cables to chargers to portable chargers and the devices themselves, that can be a lot, even for a small family. Give your family the incentive of a cool place to stow all their devices. Install a multi-charger set up with fancy stands for each person’s device on a side table in the hall or the dining room. This will naturally force them to gravitate to these charging points when they need to. You will find your table then free of wires and devices</p><p><a href=\"https://www.mygubbi.com/product-fritzi-crockery-unit\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/1.Fritzi_Front_CherryOak.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p><p><b>Dining table accessories</b>: Besides all the other things that tend to get dumped on a table, your dining accessories too can take up a lot of space. A sideboard makes the most sense for all your crockery and cutlery as well as your table mats and glasses. Rotate the task of setting the table and putting things away among all the members of the family. This way everything is put away each night before you retire. </p><p>When it comes to de-cluttering it is important that you do tasks that are only meant to be done at the table. As far as possible stick to eating at the table. Prepping food, doing homework, working on your laptop, folding laundry are all best done in their own designated places. This ensures that once your table is de-cluttered, it remains that way. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak</b>: Getting your home ready for a dog is a simple task if seen from the viewpoint of a pooch.</p><p>If you are a dog lover, you are going to lose little time in getting yourself a furry little pooch. Just as little children, a dog is a life-long responsibility and one that you have to prepare your home for. It is a fact that even dog lovers don’t really work on getting their home prepared for a four-legged friend. In most cases, you tend to deal with a situation as and when it arises. However, with a few small tips in mind, you will be able to create the perfect space for your furry friend. Here is how you can do it. </p><p><b>Look for hazards</b>: Just like we would do when child-proofing a home it is important that you look for hazards around your home for your pet. The best way to do this is to go down on all fours and take a tour of every room. If you have cleaning solutions or other harmful liquids on the floor and within reach of the dog, move them somewhere higher. Also look for wires or cables or curtain ties that may be hanging loose. Animals tend to be attracted to things that dangle and run the chance of tangling themselves in it and getting stuck. Walking around on all fours will help you look at things from their perspective and eliminate all dangers. The kitchen is another place that you need to look out for. Make sure your cutlery and knives are not in jumping distance for a dog. The same goes for your glass jars and condiment holders. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/dog_ready2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Choose the right fabrics</b>: If there is one thing a dog likes, irrespective of breed, it is something nice and soft to settle down on. So your sofas, carpets and bed linen are always going to be in their line of vision. Rather than unceremoniously chase them off your furniture, you can consider bringing in durable material in your upholstery, furnishing and linen. Woven fabrics are not a good idea because they can get caught in the claws of a dog, getting them hassled and then leading to your fabric being destroyed. Instead, linen and velvet are good ideas. Based on the kind of weather you have, tweed is also a material to consider for a dog-friendly home. These materials also ensure that a dog’s hair does not remain tangled in it and can all be easily cleaned. </p><p>An alternate to durable sofa covers would be invest in a few throw rugs and place them on the sofa or even the floor. This will help protect your sofas and carpets, yet give your dogs a place that they can proudly own. It also saves your sofa covers from dirtying up. </p><p><b>Create a Dog Space</b>: Just like humans, dogs too need a space to call their own. They often look for a cosy corner to snuggle in and sleep after romping around the house all day. Choose a corner that is not under the direct glare of the sun. Put down a throw mat, and place smaller bowls of food and water close by. Dogs love to have a comfortable crate to snooze in. Make sure you have one that comfortably fits your dog and add a layer or two of cushioning. They will appreciate this from you. Also make sure that the space you choose is not one in full view of guests. Dogs like their privacy at times and you will want a space that you are okay with having a bit of hair and a few goodies the dog digs up! </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/dog_ready3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>The small things that count</b>: If you have a back garden or a space where the dog can play, consider installing a dog door if it is within your budget. This allows the dog to head out when he wants and come back in when he chooses to. Of course, security is an issue to look into and this is an option only if you know that there is no scope for trouble involved. </p><p>If you plan to have the house deep cleaned or have exterminators come into your home for a session of debugging, it is best to move your dog away for a day or so. This will ensure that he does not inhale or take in any of the chemicals that may be floating around. </p><p>Dogs are also naturally curious animals and will always go looking for somewhere new to stick their snout. Ensure that your garbage is tightly sealed so that they have no access to anything harmful or something that may be a choking hazard. </p><p>These are just some of things you can do to get your home ready for your dog. Along the way you will find things that may be unique to your pet and you will need to work on your home accordingly. Training your dog to know his space and respect yours is something you need to do right at the beginning. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak</b>: A home gym has to be created such that it motivates you to exercise, without taking up too much space in a house. <p><p>Nothing can beat the convenience of exercising in the comfort of your own home. If you are planning on setting up a home gym, here are some pointers that will set you in the right direction. </p><p><b>Narrowing down on a space</b>: If you have a dedicated space in your home for a gym, then there is nothing more to consider. But not every home can afford to allocate a room especially for a gym. In such cases you will need to figure out where you can get the best space. Your space needs to wide enough to accommodate you through your exercise routine. While your first thoughts may go straight to your bedroom, it is best not to place your gym here. For the simple reason that you are bound to give in to the temptation of a comfortable bed and not work out. Instead, your hall, or a semi-closed balcony can make for the perfect space. </p><p>You can include side tables or have furniture with built-in storage to house small exercise equipment like dumb bells and weights. A treadmill or a stationary cycle can easily find a space in your living room or on the balcony. </p><p>Ensure that the space you choose is bright, has a lot of natural sunlight and in general gives you the feeling of being fresh and ready to take on the day. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/home_gym2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Flooring</b>: Now that you have a good space selected you need to pay attention to the flooring. Considering the equipment you bring on board for your gym and the amount of activity that is going to take place, you will need a floor that can handle it all.  If you live in an apartment and have to worry about sounds travelling down when you exercise, then muffling sounds a bit will help. This you can do by throwing down a layer or two of carpets or throw rugs. You can also place down a series of exercise mats that are generally thick, helping tone down sounds as well. </p><p><b>The right equipment<b>: As an enthusiastic first-time home gym owner you may want to invest in just about every kind of equipment there is, but do slow down a bit. Home gym equipment can be expensive and you need to pick and choose the right ones. As a first step, understand what kind of an exerciser you are. Do you prefer a mix of cardio and weights? Do you like running and yoga? Are you an aerobics person? Based on your interests, you will need to choose your equipment. It is also necessary to ensure that the space you have for your gym can fit in all of the equipment that you plan to buy. Keep in mind that you should also have a good amount of manoeuvring space around your equipment. Try and invest in exercise equipment that have multiple uses. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/home_gym3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Maintenance</b>: It is important that you maintain all of your exercising equipment well. For things like a treadmill and exercise cycle, ensure that you have regular maintenance professionals coming in to give it a check. For each of your small equipment like weights, dumb bells, yoga mat and the like, ensure that you have a dedicated space for it that keeps them in a useable condition.  </p><p><b>Enhancing your home gym</b>: Small additions to your exercise space can make a world of difference. For example, ensure that you have at least one window close to where you exercise, that you can open. Bright sunlight can keep you motivated to exercise.  Also bring in some greenery in the form of potted plants. This brightens up your space. You can also consider being close to a TV and music console; to watch video based exercises as well as listen to music when working out. </p><p>Creating a home gym is a great way to get some exercise. These few simple tips will help you create a space that you will love to head to and spend some time in. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert speak:</b> The daybed vs couch is an eternal one – and a decision on it is best made taking all of your requirements into consideration. </p><p>There are an amazing range of furniture in the market today. Add to that the fact that you can have things designed uniquely for your space, makes furniture shopping even better. A lot of furniture today is designed to be multi-functional. Take the average daybed, an addition to living room space that many prefer over a couch. But the dilemma remains as to whether a couch works better or a daybed, considering the latter makes for deep set seating that is not always comfortable. Let’s take a look at whether daybeds are really meant for you. </p><p>For starters, let’s look at the main differences between a couch and a day bed. While the first is a seating option, which also comes with a pull-out bed or additional single-seaters as a set, the other is a three-sided frame which accommodates a mattress. Both of these come with their sets of benefits and drawbacks. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/daybed_vs_couch_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Seating comfort: </b>If your priority is seating, then sofa beds would make for a much more comfortable option. They do not come with the spring base like a sofa would, but the difference when seating is barely noticeable. </p><p>The daybed on the other hand has a much greater seating depth than a sofa. The depth can be handled with the addition of pillows and cushions, however, they also lack back support which can make seating difficult. If you invest in a daybed, which has an additional trundle bed beneath, then this also increases the height of the daybed, possibly making it more uncomfortable. Unless you are exceptionally tall, and your guests are too, chances are your legs will be hanging off the edge. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/daybed_vs_couch_3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Sleeping Comfort:</b> Sofa beds are essentially sofas without the spring system and so sleeping on them makes it as comfortable as sleeping on a wider sofa space. The daybed however, supports an actual mattress of good quality, ensuring better sleeping comfort. Based on the size of the frame, you may need a box spring for support, but this will only enhance the sleeping quality. If you have friends over regularly or are living in a single studio apartment, the daybed may be a much better choice. </p><p><b>Aesthetic value: </b>When in their sofa form, sofa beds look exactly like couches and when pulled out, you have a full sized bed. In terms of aesthetics, both work well for you. A daybed however will need to be treated to bring it to look like a sofa. This means you have to bring in more cushions and fill it in. This can be a nuisance when you are using the space as a bed and have to find a place for all the cushion. Places where daybeds would work in terms of aesthetics would be your home office or your children’s room. Especially in this last one where children tend to hop on and off seating and cross their legs under them. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/daybed_vs_couch_4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Level of Flexibility:</b>Sofa beds tend to make a good looking choice, daybeds are able to give you more flexibility. These can work for a single person, without having to move furniture around to open out a bed. If you happen to have two guests, then the trundle bed attached can work wonders to ensure privacy of space, yet a comfortable sleeping spot. </p><p>A daybed is able to offer you this level of flexibility despite being conventionally smaller than a sofa. It gives you the ability to fit it into a range of spaces and rooms. It also lends itself to being moved around to where it is needed, without too much of jugglery to fit it in. </p><p>If you are looking to include a seating-cum-sleeping option in your living room, then a sofa bed would make for a better option. This is because seating is much more comfortable that a daybed, offering better lumbar support. </p><p>A family room would do great with a daybed since it is a place to lounge and some might even get comfortable enough to fall asleep. These leisurely times watching movies and after Sunday brunch. Add in a side table and all your snacks are easily on hand. </p><p>There are several plus and minus points to both the daybed and the sofa. Choose an option that is best suited to your requirements and that of your family. Evaluating each option based on its size, its aesthetics and its use in a particular room will help you arrive at the right decision. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> A white living room sets the perfect base for a versatile space that is light, airy and great to be in. </p> <p> The idea of doing your interiors up entirely in white can be seriously daunting. The thought that your space can look like the inside of a hospital is often the first thing to come to mind. But that apart, the very idea of having to maintain a white living room, especially with children and pets makes it understandable if you don’t want to go down that route. </p><p> That being said, going all white is never really going to out of fashion. It is a style statement that will live on and never look staid. If you would like to bring in a predominantly white living room, here are ideas to help you go all-white, yet bring in a wow factor. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/white_living_room_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><ol><li>Always begin with a completely white room with nothing else in it. This will help you picturise what you plan to do with it better. Sitting in a white room, you are sure to be inspired to highlight it in a brilliant one. For starters, look through the windows at the view the space offers. A view of the sea, of lovely landscaping etc, is where you want the focus to go. Highlight these views with ornate windows – gilded gold could be one way to go. Alternately, delicate wooden frames in a white room create a moving picture frame of sorts to the view you have. </li><li>Going white does not mean that you stick with a stark white shade. There are several hues that you can play with – ranging from pure white, to milky white, pearl white, cream and much more. White walls, with beige sofas and cream carpets can be one way to go. Marble tops for your side tables add in a touch of class. Wooden chairs and sofas with cream upholstery also make for a great style statement.</li> <li>Work with some interesting pairing options. Go metallic. White stands out beautifully when you have metallic accessories around the room. Think curtain rods, photo frames, TV stands and book shelves. The brilliance of metal tempers down the stark tone of white, giving you a room with interesting contrasts.</li><li>Are you worried about having completely white upholstery in your living rooms because you have kids and pets or are simply accident-prone? Well fear not, that white living room can still be yours with some ingenious thought. A living room is a heavy traffic zone and so it is best to choose materials that are easy to wipe down. Look for your favourite shades of white in faux leather or suedes. Also consider having two sets of slipcovers in shades of white that you can use should there be an accident. </li><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/white_living_room_3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><li>A lovely way to highlight a white room is to have a gorgeous centrepiece – be it a painting, artefact or an interesting show piece. Especially if you have it displayed on a completely white wall. Let your walls do the talking. Another way you can highlight a plain white wall is to create a picture gallery. Consider going frameless. This will make it seem like your pictures are emerging from the wall. </li><li>With white, a great way to make it work to your advantage is to layer things and use textures. These concepts, along with a range of hues that are available, will make your living room stand to attention. </li><li>You can also use colour to bring out the best of your white living room. Consider a red mosaic panel over your mantelpiece or perhaps an aqua coloured set of zig-zag tiles to highlight your picture gallery. There are so many ways in which to introduce that pop of colour, whether on your walls, ceiling or floor. You can consider using carpets, rugs, frames, tiles and much more.</li> </ol><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/white_living_room_4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p> One of the biggest advantages of having a white living room is that it hides any blemishes on your walls or flooring. The uniformity of white ensures that everything looks seamless. You can also benefit from the fact that such white interiors serve as a versatile base for any trends that come in, in terms of styling. White takes on a range of hues and colours as accessories and highlights. </p><p> So if you or a family member are hesitant about using white as a base for a living room, show them the multiple ways in which you can work it out to your advantage. </p>",

Making the right choices in tiles will help achieve this. </p><p>While many of us consider the bedroom or even the balcony a place of refuge from the tiredness of the day, there are quite a few who love to spend time in their bathrooms. Whether to soak in some aromatherapy oils in the tub, take a long leisurely shower or simply spend time grooming yourself, the bathroom has a lot of takers. Which is why it is imperative that you design it to look fabulous. </p><p> One way of doing this is by making some great choices in terms of the tiles you go with for your bathroom.

Many of us have a particular tile that we have admired and want to have in our homes. This would be a good time to start. </p><p>If there is no such desire, then keep in mind, when making your choices, not to exceed more than three different kinds of tiles. Typically, these are floor tiles, those for the walls/shower area and accent tiles to complete the look. </p><p>If you want to go with a show stopper tile, make sure that there is only centre piece that you are going with. This ensures that your tile work is timeless and carries across all trends that may come in. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/right_bath_tile_3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>How much time you are willing to spend in maintenance is also something to consider. Porcelain and ceramic tiles are the easiest to handle. Stone-based tiles require a great deal of maintenance, but make for excellent pieces. Glass tiles add a touch of glamour and are best used as accents and on the wall. </p><p>Consider scale as well. Large tiles in the bathroom are a standard trend, but you may want to change things up a bit. Interlocking tiles are one way to go. There are a several versions to try in this. Taking up a mix of both interlocking and regular block tiles can also add a dramatic touch. </p><p>Another aspect to remember is that bathroom tiles are not necessarily meant only for your floors. They can be used on walls, around your vanity, in the shower area etc. In fact, you can even use different tiles, both in terms of texture and colour to denote different parts of the bathroom. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/right_bath_tile_4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Choosing your Tiles</b><p>There are several pointers you need to keep in mind when stepping out to choose your tiles.

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> A hotel room can provide a great deal of inspiration for the décor of your rooms. The bedroom is a space that you can work with in multiple ways. </p><p>Don’t you just love getting away from it all? From a cozy hotel room to a plush suite at a star set-up, you have experienced it all. And now, you want to bring home some of that comfort as well. There is something so unique about the ambience in a hotel room. It is well thought of and put together décor, the furnishing, the accessories, all make it seem like you have stepped into a picture from a décor magazine. </p><p>If you would like to bring some of that hotel room magic, it is all in doing up your bedroom. Here are some tips to help:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/hotel_room_home3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Paint and Light:</b> If there is one thing you will notice about hotel rooms, is that classy ones usually go with a neutral paint on their walls. Since a hotel room is a place to relax, as is your bedroom, you are looking at shades of off-white and beige. Having these colors on the walls lends your space to several kinds of décor themes. </p><p>Once you have your paint job done, you need to work on the lighting. A hotel room usually has two forms of lighting – a source of bright functional lighting and more of the softer, yellow or white lights for when you just want to turn the covers down and kick back. Bring in a level of opulence with a chandelier in the center of your room. Install delicate reading lights on the headboards, on either side of your bed. Fill up a dark corner with a floor lamp that may illuminate the spot where you choose to have a futon or lounge chair. All of these together give your bedroom the flexibility that a hotel room offers in terms of lighting. </p><p><b>Transitional Set-up:</b> What you will notice in hotel rooms is the compact manner in which a seating space is included within the bedroom. Depending on the hotel you choose, such transitional space can range from covering wide floor spaces to more compact ones. Choose your chairs based on décor and paint. For example – dark leather Chesterfield lounge chairs or sofas work well in a wood paneled room. </p><p>For an upmarket, chic look, opt for white, soft backed lounge chairs with footstools. Including a wooden base on them would complete the picture. These will look especially good when placed next to a large window and with a contrasting carpet placed beneath it. </p><p>Such transitional settings progress naturally from seating to laying down. It is around these two elements that you can also plan the placement of your TV, bookshelves and even a sideboard. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/hotel_room_home4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>The Bed:</b> The bed is the highlight any of any hotel room. Invest in a good set of bed linen. From the cotton bed sheets to the fancy covers bring home at least two sets that you can use interchangeably. You may also consider doing up the head board section of your bed, Install, posters on each end, or perhaps have a gilded, fancy headboard installed. Place a fancy painting over the bed and make sure to have a spotlight on it that brings it to life. This also serves as a great night light if you are looking for one. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/hotel_room_home5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Make the Room Self-Sufficient:</b> The décor in hotel room is designed to make the place a fully functional one. Here is how you can do it as well. Every bedroom needs a small workshop for your laptop, and other gadgets. Based on space you can consider having one that is wall mounted and with a functional number of shelves. In fact, since you will also want entertainment in the room, you could consider using an entire wall for a modular unit that will house your TV as well as your workstation. </p><p>This modular unit can also give you the space you need to set up a coffee machine station or a small bar area. A nightcap just before bed is a luxury that most hotels offer you, so why not at home. Bring in some potted plants as well. This gives the room a nice refreshing feel. </p><p>The great thing about designing a room to resemble a hotel is that there are several ideas that you can claim for your own. Based on the size of your bedroom and the amount of furniture you can get in there, you will find numerous ways to do up your space. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> A reading nook is the perfect getaway you will need for when you want to escape into the world of books. Create one that you will head straight for everyday. </p><p>No matter how hectic life gets, a book lover will always find the time to settle down with a good one. Often we find ourselves reading in bed, or taking a book or two when on vacation. You may find a great place to read just about anywhere, but how about creating one in the comfort of your own home. You will be amazed at the number of possibilities when it comes to book reading nooks across your home. A little imagination and creativity can result in a wonderful space. Here are some ways in which to create a reading corner in your home. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/4.010_1200_bookcase_s1_d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Look for that one bright corner in your home – next to a window. This is the perfect space to set up your reading corner. During the day, it will be nice and bright naturally, giving you ample light to read. You can also working on the lighting with the use of sheer curtains. Place a nice lounge chair close to the window. Next to it can go a floor lamp that you can use to read by, in the evenings or late at night. You can make the chair more comfortable by propping up cushions around it, or have a small matching footstool at the base. A book or a magazine rack can be placed close to the chair giving you a choice of reading material. This rack can also house a bottle of water and space to charge your phone so that you do not have to venture too far when you have settled down to read. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/1.Bruno_front_brown-oak_creme.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>A large bay window can be used to create a seating bench that is an extension of the window. This gives you room to stretch your legs out, while reading. It also gives you an opportunity to gaze out of the window when you want to take a small break from your book. Should you decide to take a nap, you will be set thanks to the many cushions you should include in this space. A low profile bookcase placed close to the bay seating area will hold your books and other essentials.</p> <p>Apart from your windows, you can create a reading nook in a space that you are most comfortable in. Perhaps a corner in your living room or in the bedroom. The simplest way to set up such a nook is to choose a corner that is not in the way of foot traffic. This will ensure that you are not constantly disturbed when you are reading. You can liven up the space by placing a small sideboard to hold your books, a lamp, a flower vase or perhaps photo frames. Alternately, you could consider having a magazine rack on one side and simply piling up your books on the floor next the chair. Include a tall floor lamp for the late night reads and you are set. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/1.Simone_front_oak.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>If you are a book lover, for sure you would have passed the reading bug down to other members of the family. You could create a reading nook for two people. This concept works great in rooms for adults as well as children. Invest in two comfortable chairs – lounge style is the best kind as it gives you the comfort needed for long hours of reading. Place these a distance apart and a narrow bookshelf in between them. This shelf can serve both readers with space to stack up reading materials of their choice. You can also bring in small stools on either sides of the chairs for space to place a cup of coffee, the phone or even small reading lamps. Work on thematic styled seating for your children’s room. </p><p>Have an awkward corner in the house? Perhaps at the top of the staircase, or on an usually broad landing? This is the perfect spot to create a floor based reading nook. All you have to do is place a comfortable and soft mat or carpet on the floor. Throw on cushions that you can pile into the corner to prop yourself up or use to lie down and read. Wall-mount a set of narrow bookshelves or for that matter, simply use the floor to pile your books up. Keep a small stool or sideboard handy to use for your coffee pot, water, phone and other essentials. </p><p>There are a multitude of ways in which you can create a gorgeous reading corner for yourself. A good interior designer will be able to spot and create such spaces for you. Once done, you will seek out these places to get lost in the world of fiction and adventure. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> Sideboards are a versatile pieces of furniture that can find multiple uses in just about every room of the house. </p><p>Over time, there have been several décor elements that have been created to address specific needs. Sideboards are one of them. When these first came about, they were created to as serving units to be placed in dining rooms specifically. It was a place, where a buffet could be set up on the top and all necessary cutlery and table top requirements could be housed in drawers and shelves below. Today, this décor element has come a long way and now finds multiple uses in homes. Here are some of the ways in which you can include it in your home’s décor:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/6_1600_Side_Open.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>In the Bedroom:</b> Whether you have a dressing table in your bedroom or not, a low profile sideboard can be quite the useful thing to have. A dresser may be filled with all your cosmetics, toiletries and other items of daily use. It tends to be a space that is overfull, especially if it is one you share with a spouse, or one siblings share with one another. A sideboard can be a beautiful space to store accessories such as stoles, jewelry, socks as well as underwear. The top surface can be a place to display photographs, carry a vase or a simple piece of artwork. In children’s rooms, it may be a space to display creative works.<p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/009_1600_Side_Open.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>The Living Area: </b>You can never run out of ways to use to your sideboard in the living room. Instead of a bulky TV cabinet, you could consider this for placement. Its drawers and shelves may also be used to hide all your electronics like the music system, the Blue Ray player and even your set top box. It makes a great space for all your gaming requirements as well. </p><p>If you have an open plan living room, place a sideboard behind a sofa that is not placed against a wall. It allows you to create an interesting talking point. If placed against a wall, create a wall vignette with picture frames and artefacts to complete the look.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/011_1800_Side_Open.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>In an Office Space:</b> This is something to consider for your home office or your regular working space. Rather than have staid filing cabinets, why not give a sideboard some space, as a storage unit to hold all your important paper. The top layer of drawers may be used to hold smaller stationary requirements such as paper clips, staples, and pens. The lower cabinets may be used to create a simple filing systems. Use the top to personalize your office space a bit – a set of favorite books with artistic book ends, or perhaps a collection of good alcohol or even a small gallery of your family photos. </p><p><b>In Broad Corridors:</b> Most homes today have at least one corridor that leads from one part of the home to another. Rather than leave it empty, a narrow, long sideboard would make a perfect addition here. Another great place to include it is in the awkward little space that forms below a staircase. This may be used to store just about anything that you need – from extra linen for the bedroom and dining room, to toy collections, books, music and movie CDs and more. Of course, the top is completely open to your imagination. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/013_1800_Side_Open.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The great thing about sideboards is that they lend themselves to just about any kind of décor theme that you have going. From a Victorian styled version with detailed crevices, to more contemporary ones with straighter lines, this décor element is a versatile one. Thanks to the numerous designs that come up, you can choose to have a model that is completely enclosed in terms of solid doors and drawers. Alternately, you could choose to go with models that have some door-less cabinets. This gives you an interesting way of displaying your belongings. </p><p>Sideboards also are available in a range of sizes. While you may have a square one for a small space, you could go with the rectangular versions of varying lengths to suit the kind of space you have. Your interior designer will be able to guide you on the kind that will best suit the area you plan to have it in. </p><p>So if the plan is to bring something new into the home, consider a sideboard as an element in your room furniture.

Now that is just the thing you may want to do with your attic or the odd bedroom that you may have. Give it a faux wooden flooring, throw in a low, well cushioned sofa, have a simple wooden table in the corner and the room becomes anything you want it to be – your retreat from the world, a place to relax or a space to entertain guests. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/rom_com_idea3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Castle:</b> Now Richard Castle’s study and home office is a space that you want for your home. Begin with sliding doors. Include massive bay windows in the design as well. And consider have ceiling to floor bookshelves and organize all your books alphabetically. Place your study table centrally, so that you are the first thing people see when they enter your space. Ensure it has enough of space to accommodate all your gadgets in one go. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/rom_com_idea4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Vampire Diaries:</b> Which one of us doesn’t lovely the regal looking home of Damon and Stefan Salvatore. If you are planning a vintage look for your home, then this is the one to consider. A large fireplace place and living spaces that are on varying levels of steps is the way to go. Wooden paneling is a highlight of the home here, with ambient lighting and heavy furnishing to complete the look.</p> <p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/rom_com_idea5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Friends:</b> Now this is one classic serial that can never get old. Do you remember Monica and Rachel’s apartment? An eclectic mix of furniture is what made up the space. Each of the walls had a color of their own – with one usually popping out to grab attention. Photo frames were of the gilded variety, including the blank one placed over the door’s peep-hole. If you walk across to Joey’s apartment, the single entertainment unit between Chandler and Joey’s room that housed their TV and VCR can be something that works in any house. And can you ever forget those Lazy Boys and the Foosball table?</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/rom_com_idea6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Sleepless in Seattle:</b> New York at its best was brought to live in the culmination of the movie – Sleepless in Seattle. In fact, many fans of the film admit to spending a long time thinking of Sam’s gorgeous Seattle Boathouse. You can steal this look for your home by bringing in some nautical elements into your home.

Add in elements of weathered metal such as clocks, little anchors and even photo frames. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/rom_com_idea7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>The Holiday:</b> There is something about the vintage home in the Holiday that remains etched in all our minds. The entire home brings to mind a classic English setting, complete with a fireplace, wooden dining table next to the hearth and push trolleys as well. You can get this look for your home, especially your kitchen and dining areas by bringing in wooden storage units, metal push carts with chequered table cloths and even tables and chairs with distressed metal elements.

In fact, a similar serial that comes to mind is “Ugly Betty”. The interiors of both these imaginary fashion magazine offices are seriously something that you would like to bring home with you. To achieve these looks, always go with clean and sharp lines. Your furniture has to make a statement and stand out against a backdrop of any sort. This gives you a good base to work with in terms of a color palette that you can keep changing according to the latest trends that are in. </p><p>Every movie and serial that comes about has an interesting décor element that you can see in it. Take Indian movies like Farhan Akhtar’s character’s home in Rock On! or Hrithik’s character’s home in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. The opulence of Sanjay Leela Bansali’s sets can also be a great source of inspiration for your home décor. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> Planning a romantic dinner with your partner is about setting up the perfect ambience. Lighting, table settings and some light music are elements you should be thinking of. </p><p><b>Valentine’s Day</b> may have just come and gone, but that doesn’t mean that the romance needs to die out immediately. Organizing a romantic evening is something you must indulge in, with your partner, to keep the spark alive. In this day and age, when life is so hectic, we often have to make a conscious effort to spend time with each other. Here are some tips to help you set up a romantic dinner for your partner, right in the comfort of your home. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/tips_rom_dine2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p></b>Take care of the Basics:</b> For any evening to be a success, you need to have basics sorted out. Make sure that the date you have in mind is one where both of you will be free from any work based commitments that may go late into the night. The last thing you want is to be is on-call during a romantic dinner date. While at it, make sure that you don’t have an early morning the next day as this can be a dampener to spending quality time with each other. If you have children, make sure they have a sleepover at a trusted friend’s place. With these taken care of, you are now ready to plan your evening. </p><p><b>Plan the Menu:</b> An important element of your romantic dinner is the meal itself. Plan a simple, yet elegant meal of three courses and some finger foods. Pair your meal with drinks of your choice – wines or spirits. When planning the menu try and see if there is something that you can do together – perhaps prep and toss and salad together or put the finishing touches to dessert together. This goes a long way in enhancing the romance of the evening. </p><p>When planning your food, make sure that it is a meal that can be prepped and prepared completely in advance, with just the finishing touches to be added before you serve it up. The last thing you want to be doing is running to the kitchen each time you hear the oven ping. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/tips_rom_dine1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Planning your Décor:</b> Now, coming to the most important part of this romantic date night – the décor. If you have a dining table – set it up for an intimate meal for two. Take away the extra chairs and table placements. You could opt for the clichéd, but always dependable candle settings, or you could place a delicate table top that add to the ambience. Should you have dimmers in your dining room, you could use these to set up the right lighting. Flowers always add a nice touch.</p><p>If you would rather do something different, scout around the house to find interesting places to dine. Why not create a floor seating with your coffee table serving as the dining spot. All your decorative elements can be placed around this table, on the side tables, mantelpiece and even your book shelves. Throw down a rug and some cushions as well to help you relax with your drinks and nibbles. </p><p>You could also consider taking things outside. If you have a wide enough balcony, set up your dining spot outside. Nothing speaks romance like having a meal outdoors, where you can watch the bustle of the city go by, yet be nestled in the comfort of your home and each other. A few additional arrangements you may have to make will include better lighting, if the space doesn’t have dedicated light options. You will also need to place mosquito repellants, because they can play spoilsports. </p><p>Planning a romantic evening with your partner is all about setting the perfect ambience. A few simple décor tricks can help you do a perfect job of it. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p>You have the shell of your home ready and are now looking to do it up. Or perhaps it’s time to give the décor of your home an overhaul. If you are looking for a complete change of scene as far as your décor goes but, are lacking the inspiration, here are 10 interesting quotes from top designers to help you along. </p><p><b><i>“Measuring and laying out the room in advance can save you lots of headaches”</i>. – David Bromstad</b> - It is very easy to get carried away when planning the décor of a room. Suddenly you realize that everything you have bought to place in the room does not have a designated space or is too cramped. When you plan to do a room up, it is important that you have the space completely measured. If you are sure of what you want to include, measure space for each element and ensure that you have enough left over to maneuver around the room. If you can get your designer to give you a 3D render of the space, then you will be able to see for yourself, what works and what doesn’t. </p><p><b><i>“Every room needs a touch of black just as it needs one antique piece”.</i> – Jan Showers</b> – There are times when a room requires a touch of something to make it come to life. Black can be just that element. You may use this in multiple ways – a black TV cabinet, or a black and glass center table or even black floating shelves. You could consider having all your photo frames on the wall in black. Or have black runners on your dining table. There are some many ways to introduce this color to give your home a great look. Also, bring out that heirloom antique piece and give it pride of place. </p><p><b><i>“If you love something, it will work. That’s the only rule”</i>. - Bunny Williams </b>– If there is a particular element of décor that you love – perhaps your old sofa, or a family heirloom swing, or sofa backs that your grandmother stitched for you at your wedding, they can easily be introduced into just about any décor. The idea with any interior designing is not to stick with the tried and tested, but rather come up with something new, with what you have. Share your thoughts with your interior designer to see how it can be used.</p> <p><b><i>“A room should never allow the eye to settle in one place. It should smile at you and create fantasy”</i>. – Juan Montaya</b> – It is not necessary to have only one focal point in your room. You can choose to have many different ones. Have a gallery wall up on one side; organize an interesting showcase of your knick-knacks on the other. Bring in a pop of color on your sofas or have intricate looking lighting fixtures. This will give a newcomer to your home so much to look at and enjoy. </p><p><b><i>“Your home should tell the story of who you are and be the collection of what you have”</i>. – Nate Berkus </b>– Every home is the reflection of your personality. Allow your home to tell the story of who you are in every room. Are you a flamboyant person – then your color palette can reflect the same. Do you prefer a calm and peaceful lifestyle – your décor can suggest that. Every interior designer goes through a great deal of trouble to understand your personality and help your home reflect it all. </p><p><b><i>“My idea of comfort is a good lamp to read by”</i>. – Lucien Rees Roberts</b> – There is nothing like curling your favorite sofa and reading a book. A lovely reading lamp can enhance the look of just about any room. From the living room, to the bedroom and to your study, there are a range of lamps – table top, floor or even ceiling suspended to choose from. Let your lamp be your reading companion and brilliant décor element. </p><p><b><i>“Exquisite details make interiors sing” </i>– Larry Laslo</b> – At the end of the day it’s all about the finer details. When you are exploring options for your interior décor, make sure to look at the smaller details. When you buy curtains, ensure complementary curtain ties. Let your paint match your sofas, let photo frames complement the showcase you have and so on. Try to connect elements to bring in a sense of symmetry to your interiors. </p><p><b><i>“Make sure the space is practical and can be converted to a general-use room after had its day as a playroom”</i>. – Garrison Hullinger</b> – It is very important that your interior décor has a practical side to it. Of course you want your décor to be aesthetically pleasing, but this should not be at the cost of practicality. Ensure that every décor element has a purpose and is well-utilized. If needed, you  must be able to push it all aside and create a neutral space. </p><p><b><i>“Pick what you like because living with a trend that is not you is never a good choice”</i> - Thomas Pheasant</b> – It is very tempting to go with the latest trends, however if that trend does not really work for you, then it will be difficult living with. Trends come and go, it does not cost much for them to appear. But, décor elements can be expensive and you want to be sure you have something you like. </p><p><b><i>“Lighting is an essential way to change the mood of a room, especially if you can use dimmers”</i>. – Thom Filicia</b> – And last but not least, the lighting elements you choose for your home can work towards creating a fabulous ambience. Include dimmers and the ambience will be in your complete control. This works for every room in your home, bathrooms included. Nothing like ambient lighting and soothing music while taking a shower. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b> Bedrooms need not be staid, boring places. There are so many small elements you can introduce in your bedrooms that will make it great place to spend time in. </p><p>Your bedroom is your own private space; one where you can let down your guard and totally relax. It is a place that you come to at the end of a long day to completely relax and unwind. You will want the décor of your bedroom to be soothing and induce a state of relaxation. You will also not want the space to be a boring one. Here are some ways to make your bedroom the best place on earth:</p><p>Choosing a color scheme for your bedroom is also an important task. In fact, it is the first element you need to think of when decorating your bedroom. Go with a three-color palette and not more. Some popular color combinations are red/yellow/orange; brown/blue/white and golden yellow/dark brown/white.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/Gambel_Wardrobe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Of course you have a bed in the room, but have you ever considered how comfortable a seating option can be as well. Introduce a nice, large chair, cushion-backed at the foot of your bed. If you have the space, you can also place it next to your window. This is the space you can use for some late night book reading or simply to settle down with a nightcap. When placed close to the window, it will give you a great view of the world outside – when it is asleep or slowly waking up to a new day. The only this to remember is to not make this chair a dump-yard for clothes and other accessories.</p><p>If you have large empty spaces on your walls, consider creating a gallery wall. There are so many possibilities with this – a family tree, a collection of your family’s achievements, the theme of your favorite sport and so one. Never leave a wall blank. Give it some element to rest the eyes on. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/2.blackduck_int.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Change your curtains. If you have thick and heavy drapes for privacy, you can still retain those. However, install a layer of sheer curtains and have only them drawn close in the night. As soon as a new day dawns the lovely sunlight coming in will be a pleasure to wake up to.</p><p>Work on your <b>side tables</b> or night stands. Both sides need not be the same in a shared bedroom. This is simply because both of you have different tastes and needs from your stand. Create a look for your side tables in such a way that the look for each side of the room is complete. Color coordinate cushions and table cloths to bring in a flow of sorts.</p><p>There is so much you can play with in terms of <b>wall décor</b> for your bedroom as well. Bring in wall decals of different types. Your designer will be able to help you get through a range of options to find one best suited for your room. One preferred option is to go with decals of nature – silhouettes of trees, animals and people too. In fact, you can even consider a decal of a chandelier for your bedroom in lieu of an actual one.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/Dove_Wardrobe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Wall décor may also be introduced in the form of frames – these can be of photos, of posters or even fabric of your choice. One options is to have a series of same sized artwork over the head of your bed. This adds a touch of glamour to the space. </p><p>There are several other smaller ways in which to glam up your bedroom. Add some character to your bed by installing bed posts or canopies. If you already have those, you can consider removing them and adding in a shelved headboard instead. This will give you the space to add in knick knacks, lighting options and more. </p><p>Install mirrors around your bed. In fact, one of the ceiling adds an interesting dimension to your bedroom. If you plan to install some artefacts around the room, especially on the window sills, consider bringing items that have the same color scheme as your bed sheets or pillow covers. This gives a sense of continuity to the room. </p><p>Finally you come to the lighting options you have for your space and this is the most important element. In a bedroom, you must have the ability to have aesthetic lighting that is both functional as it is ambient. Making the ample use of dimmers is what will help you achieve that balance. </p><p>These are a few ways in which you can create the best place on earth for you to come back to each day. Soon you will see that the place will become a retreat for all the members of your family.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak:</b>There are several options for wall décor for you to choose from. Each of them lend a sense of identity and glamour to your walls.</p><p>The simplest way to glamourize your rooms is to get some wall <b>art</b> and décor up. This can be for your homes, or offices. There are several options available in the market for you to consider. Fear not! There are numerous choices for every budget as well. Besides jazzing up a boring wall, such <b>art</b> can bring in an element of beauty and glamour.</p><p>Walk into any space with bare walls that are shabby and you feel the need to get away after a point. Great wall <b>art</b> can be extremely welcoming, even if on a sub-conscious level. Here are some options you can consider to glam up your walls:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/glam_up_living4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Wall Art:</b> The idea of buying <b>art</b> for your walls can be an intimidating one. Do you go in for a renowned painter and spend lots on a painting, or do you take a chance of some unheard artistes and give them a chance on your wall. <b>Art</b> need not be a scary thought. All you have to do is go with your sense of beauty and mentally visualize how a painting will look in your space.</p><p>For starters, size up how much space you have on your walls to dedicate to <b>art</b>. Also have a rough idea of how big you may want your paintings or how small. If you plan to include spot lights to highlight these paintings, this is another aspect that will need measurements and calculation for the right spacing. A general rule of thumb is that a frame should fill about 2/3rd – 3/4th a wall. If your choice is contemporary, then the bigger the better in terms of impact.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/glam_up_living3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Always make sure to hang your frames at eye level. Take the average height of people in your home and those who visit and place the painting at this height. </p><p>If you plan to use photographs as artwork on your walls, then its best to mount them on glass or on acrylic frames. Try action shots as far as possible – these give a sense of movement to your space.</p><p>You could also try and create a gallery wall of multiple small pieces of art in varying sizes. This is a long-term project to work on and can have additions of paintings or artwork that have significance to your at various stages of life.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/glam_up_living2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Posters:</b> You may think that posters are a thing for children and their rooms. In fact, a large number of homes today, sport some great posters on their walls in a bid to glamorize their space. Posters are a great way of showcasing some of your interests. For example, a lover of football would love to have a poster of Ronaldo or Messi in the process of scoring a goal. If cooking is a passion, then some great food posters can fill up the walls of your dining room and even kitchen for that matter. There are so many themes to consider – automotives, history, authors, book covers, film posters and the like. Give your space an identity of its own with a range of posters available.</p><p><b>Fabric on Your Walls:</b> You will be amazed at the number of ways in which you can bring fabric onto your walls. To start with you could consider using fabric in the form of wallpaper, rather than actual wallpaper. This is a relatively simple DIY and is done using starch on the walls to hold the fabric fast. When you want a change, all you have to do is peel of the cloth and you can begin afresh.</p><p>Besides that, you can consider place a fabric piece of your choice in a stretcher frame and simply hanging this up on your wall. In fact, embroidery rings make for some fabulous frames. You could also considering framing fabric pieces up in different sizes and placing them across your room. This gives a sense of continuity to your décor as well.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/glam_up_living.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Wall Paper your Rooms: If you find that paint has never been able to bring to life a room the way you would like it to, then you must consider wallpaper. Wallpapers are no longer the bright yellows and blues of yesteryears. They have come of age and how. If you are looking to make a statement wall in a room then going with a bold print is a good idea. However, be sure of what you are purchasing and how it will look, because this is something that you will have to live with for a while.</p><p>Alternately, you can consider textured and patterned wallpaper of many kinds. This helps hide any blemishes or unevenness on your walls.</p><p>If you would like your wallpaper to be a bit functional as well, remember that horizontal stripes help make a room look wide and vertical stripes make a ceiling look higher than it is. Light wallpapers make a room look bigger and darker papers bring it down in size. Large patterns are ideal to bring a sense of coziness to a room.</p><p>There is just so much you can do to glamourize your walls. Look through the various options available and make a smart choice for your walls.</p>",

Create the perfect ambience to do so with these décor ideas.</p><p><b>Valentine’s Day</b> is that special time of the year when you want to do something special for the one you love, even if it is a small thing. Of course, your love does not diminish during the year, but it is fun to do something romantic together. Considering how miserable traffic can be in most cities, it would be a great idea to bring the celebrations home. This would be doing up your home in a romantic way. Here are some tips for your living room and your bedroom.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/valen_living3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>The Living Room</b></p><p>Red and pink are often considered the colors of Valentine’s Day. So ensure that this is part of your color palette for all the elements that you introduce into your rooms. If you have an open showcase, or a set of floating shelves you can create a Valentine’s display. Fill the space up with red aroma candles, some red and pink balloons and don’t forget to include photo frames of you and your partner. Family photos also make a great addition. Bring out your creative skills and make some red streamers to complete the look.</p><p>Whether you plan to cook for your partner or order in, how about moving the dining part of your evening to the living room. Use a side table that may be in the living room, or perhaps the coffee table to create an intimate space. Try and include red crockery and offset it with glass elements such as wine flutes. Add in a candle or two. If that comes in the way, surround the spaces around your little dining spot with candles. This lends a nice ambient lighting to the space.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/valen_living2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Thanks to technology today there is hardly a thing that cannot be customized. If you are looking to make some interesting additions to your living room décor for Valentine’s Day, how about specially created Him and Her cushions. There are so many ways you can work this out – digital pictures of both of you or the family, especially hand crafted cushions that have intricate painting, embroidery or some of the classic art forms like crochet or tatting. Or perhaps cushions that have a collage of all your photographs together. There are just so many possibilities to consider.</p><p>Flowers – nothing says <b>Valentine’s Day</b> like flowers. Go with your partner’s favorite or deck up the living room with a floral theme of your choice. Intersperse this with candles, photographs and other knick knacks that may be integral to your life together. You will be amazed at how much of a difference this makes to your décor. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/valen_bedroom.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>The Bedroom</b></p><p>Of course, the standard satin sheets and petal strewn bedcovers are immediate options, but there are so many more ways in which your bedroom may be decorated for Valentine’s Day.</p><p>While you can start with these elements, you can add to the idea in many more ways. To start with, if your headboard has shelves incorporated into it, you can add in elements such as candles, scented or otherwise, along with a collection of images of the both of you.</p><p>The bedroom is a place where you can play with lighting to a large extent. Install dimmers on your bedside lamps if you do not already have them. Bring in strings of LED lights and stuff them into bottles of different colors and place them all around the room. This may need a little work in terms of wiring, but the final effect will be breathtaking.</p><p>You could also consider bringing in a small power operated water body into the bedroom. Nothing soothes the mind and soul like the sound of flowing water.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/valen_living.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Try something interesting in your bedroom. If just for a day, you can pull the mattress off the bed, and stow away the cot, do that. Place the mattress on the floor, add on multiple layers of soft, flowing sheets and lots of cushions all around. Place candles at safe distances around the mattress, bring in a tray with chocolates and champagne or wine to complete the scene. </p><p>The one thing about Valentine Day’s decoration for your home is that you can customize it to any level. You have to let your imagination take over and create the perfect scene for you and your partner to share some great time together. All the décor you come up with will go a long way in creating memories for a lifetime.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<p><b>Expert Speak: </b>There are some simple, yet inexpensive ways to brighten up your home and give it a whole new look. Why don’t you consider some of these?</p><p>Tired of the way your home looks. No amount of natural sunlight brightening up your decor? Looking for some inexpensive ways to liven up your home? Here are 7 simple ways in which to give your home a facelift. </p><p><b>Go in for a Paint Change:</b> The simplest way to brighten up a room is to give it a nice bright coat of white paint. This is a color that instantly brightens up a room and also reflects natural light, giving any space an instant uplift. If you would rather not have all your walls covered with the same paint, you could consider using white on specific parts of your room – like the landing and the staircase, coupled with a sofa back in white perhaps. Instead of paint, you may also consider textured wall paper. All this can make a world of difference to how bright your room looks.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/7_ways_living3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Work on the Profile of your Furniture:</b> There are several ways to treat your furniture – going contemporary, bohemian, Victorian or minimalistic are just some of the ways to go. But if you are looking for a complete change without burning a hole in your pocket, then you may consider going with low profile furniture. Move away the seating in your living room and create ottomans and seating nooks on the floor. Move your dining furniture away to other rooms and create a small, set-up with a lower profile. Perhaps you would like to go the Asian or Arabian way with your seating. Going with a low profile set up can work wonders for the way your room looks.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/2.Falcon_int.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Revisit your Rooms:</b> You may be so used to looking at a room in particular way, you sometimes fail to see that it may be utilized in several new ways. Evaluate each room and look for hidden potential. A spare bedroom, used as a gym can change into a lounge area. The little space attached to the kitchen can work as a prep area. Adding a few all-weather seating furniture in your backyard, will help you take in a bit of nature. Relook each room and try to picture it as something that you have never tried before.</p><p><b>Add more Space:</b> Now this is an aspect that will need professional help coming in. There are times when a non-load bearing wall can simply be in the way. Rather than have it, you may consider breaking it down to open up some space for you. This is especially if this walls lies between the living and dining rooms and the kitchen as well. Bringing down one wall will help you blend three spaces together creating a much larger room.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/7_ways_living2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Switch to Built-In:</b> A great way to open up space in any room is to switch to built-in furniture. This becomes more economical when you do it room by room. Begin with bedrooms and install built-in cupboards as well as modular work tables and book shelves. In your kitchen switch to ceiling length cabinetry to give you all the space that you need, without taking up precious floor area. These small changes will make your rooms much bigger and give you an open feel.</p><p><b>Utilize Unused Rooms:</b> Most homes tend to have a small spaces that are unutilized. For example – a large balcony can be converted to an indoor garden area or be semi-enclosed and then used as a seating area. Storage rooms can be fitted to become libraries, wine bars and more, rather than dumping grounds that they usually end up being. Have a professional evaluate your home and understand where space may be utilized in a better manner.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/7_ways_dining.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Bring in the Light:</b>  Most of the time we under-estimate how much of a difference good lighting can make. Open up your curtains in all your rooms. Look down corridors. If you find that they are dark during the day time, they will only be more so in the evenings. Invest in some good light fixtures to liven the space up. Make sure that your entrance is well lit up too, as this is the first space that people stand at when visiting your home. Utilize dimmers where you can. This will help you work on ambient lighting which can make a world of difference to how things will look.</p><p>Work on each of these elements to see how much of a difference they can make to your home. It will open up the space that you have and make your home look more inviting. </p>",

It comes in various sizes, each of which can have the maximum impact in the space that it is placed with. It is so versatile, that it can be used on its own, or teamed with a set of cushion. Some enthusiastic designers have also used these as sofa backs and as wall-mounted pieces to break the monotony of a large, monochrome wall. If you are planning to purchase a rug, here is all you will need to help you make the right decision. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/Cardinal_Wardobe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>The Basics:</b> First let\u2019s look at why you want to buy a rug and where you plan to use it. This will help you in the next stage, which is choosing the right material for your rugs. Ask yourself the following questions</p><ul><li >Is this rug for the indoors or outdoors? </li><li >Will it see high foot traffic or less?</li><li >Is it meant to be functional or aesthetic or a mix of both?</li><li >How big an area are you looking at covering?</li><li >How much of maintenance are you willing to undertake?</li><li >Will the rug be completely on its own, or will you have furniture placed on a part of it?</li><li >And finally, what is your budget?</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/Gambel_Wardobe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>All of this will help you go to the next stage of your research, the kind of fibers you should be looking at. Here is a look at the different kinds of fibers in the market:</p><p><b><i>Wool:</i></b> This has long been the favorite choice of most rug makers across the world. It is a great material that serves as the perfect base for an area with lot of foot traffic. It naturally helps keep your feet insulated in the cold and always offers a soft cushioning. Flat weave wool rugs are the most durable, those with longer weaves, can take on a beautiful hue in the long run and add character to your space. What you have to remember is that wool rugs have to be professionally cleaned. </p><p><b><i>Cotton:</i></b> The more casual and definitely more affordable of rug materials, this is a popular choice. You will find them in flat weaves as well those that are braided. The fact that you can easily dye them in range of colors makes the versatile and thus easily compatible to most interior themes. These may be washed in machines, but their durability depends completely on usage and maintenance. What it can do is give you the opportunity to purchase new rugs every once in a while, without feeling like you have over-spent. </p><p><b><i>Natural fibers:</i></b> Across the world, there are a range of natural fibers that you can think of investing in. Jute is the most popular along with sea grass and Sisal which are commonly sought after. All of these materials are tough and take a good beating, making them perfect for homes. Jute is the softest of all these materials and gives a rustic look to a home. Each of these materials has a distinctive look and feel and so the choice is clearly up to you and what will work for you. Maintenance level is average, though stain removal can be difficult. </p><p><b><i>Ornamental Rugs:</i></b> These are usually expensive materials and indigenous to various countries. India has a number of traditional rug makers with unique offerings. So too some Japanese rug makers and other oriental weavers. Of course the European countries do have their share of interesting rug weaves. Your budget will help you decide if there is an option that works for you. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/products/3.Karl_Front_Brown_larch.jpeg?v=1447064613\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Exploring Weaves</b></p><p>Another integral part of making a choice in rugs is understanding the various weaves and choosing one that suits you the best. Most rugs are still traditionally hand-made and it would be a good idea to encourage indigenous and local artisans working on these rugs rather than go in for the machine-made ones. Some of the weaves are:</p><p><b><i>Hand-knots:</i></b> This is the most labor-intensive method of rug creation where lengths of yarn are hand knotted to form a patch that is part of a larger rug. The density of knots per square inch also determines the quality and ruggedness of a rug. </p><p><b><i>Tufts:</i></b> These may be made by hand or by machine and make use of backing material into which loops of yarn are placed to create tufts. This also for the weaver to create a design that is multi-dimensional. The hooked version is where an additional layer of cloth is added to the back of a rug with tufts. </p><p><b><i>Flatweave:</i></b> These are rugs that are created without a raise in the materials. Dhurries are a good example of such rugs. </p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/Partridge_Wardobe.jpg\" alt=\"\"><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p><b>Choosing the Right Size: </b>If you are looking for a rug to cover most of your room with an average size of 12 feet by 14 feet, you want a rug that is no bigger than 10 feet. This ensures that there is an equal amount of open floor left around it. </p><p>A large living room may need more than one rug to make the room look balanced. If you have two parts to your room \u2013 a conversation area and a lounge area, choose rugs accordingly. </p><p>An entryway can use a runner rather than a complete rug, similarly hall ways need rugs that display a minimum of 6 inches of floor all around. If you are placing rug below your dining table, ensure it extends to at least 18 inches beyond the outer edge of your table. This is so feet are not snagged when moving around. Of course, in bedrooms you have to ensure that the rug sticks out a decent distance from the edge of your bed so that you do not end up putting your feet down on a cold floor. </p><strong>With this guide to purchasing rugs, you are sure to find one that best suits your d\u00e9cor, your tastes and of course your budget. </strong>",

    "blog_content": "<b>Expert Speak: </b>Your bathroom can go from being dull to a space you want to spend some extra time in with just a few small upgrades. Here is some tips to help</p><p><b><strong>Your bathroom is your private sanctuary. In fact, many would say it is the place where they get the most peace in a day. On a lighter note it is space that sparks some of the most innovative ideas. So don\u2019t these make the perfect reasons for you to consider some interesting makeovers for your bathroom? Here are some thoughts to work with:</strong></b></p><p><b><strong><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/5_1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></b></p><p><b>The Vanity Area:</b> This is often the most cluttered and staid places in a bathroom. The first step to upgrading this area is to begin with taking away all the clutter that is there. Take a look at your mirror? Is it a functional one? Then this would be the first place to work on. Based on the d\u00e9cor theme you have, you may want to change the frame of your mirror \u2013 an ornate one, a metal one, or even one with some intricate mosaic work \u2013 there are many options to choose from. </p><p>If you do not have dedicated lighting for this space, you may want to consider including this as well. Begin with lighting up the area around the mirror. Wall mounted little LEDs make a world of difference. Alternately you could consider larger tungsten white bulbs that give you a star\u2019s greenroom effect. Wall-mounted light fixtures give an elegant look to your vanity too. </p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/02_bffa67f1-4738-4b24-8a47-3cdcab11c7a7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Cabinets: </b>The next on your to-do list for a bathroom make over should be your cabinetry. Most bathrooms tend to have dull cabinetry, but there are several options in the market that you can choose from today. Go with a pristinely white cabinet with patterned drawer knobs and bun feet. Alternately you could choose to have a stone-finished sink placed over a pastel shaded drawer and cabinet unit. Metal knobs make for a beautiful addition. </p><p>While knobs are one option consider, you may also choose to go with handles that can be pulled. These are available in a several options of materials. </p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/04.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Flooring tiles and Bath Floor Materials: </b>The bathroom floor often tends to be a boring white or beige and very run of the mill. That is where a complete change of floor materials can make a world of difference. If you have light-colored fixtures and cabinetry, you may want to consider a darker mix of flooring material. The range of materials are numerous and you may want to have your designer close on hand to help you make the right choices. </p><p>A slight change in textures for the bathroom floor and actual shower area will help make clear distinctions and add a sense of layering to your bathroom d\u00e9cor. </p><p><b>Fixtures:</b> Often a change in the simplest of elements can result in some amazing visual changes in your space. Take a look at all the fixtures in your bathroom \u2013 from your faucets to the lighting and even to the slats on your windows. Each of these may be upgraded to create a completely different look to your bathroom. </p><p>Faucets especially come in interesting ranges, some of which work on water-saving principles and activate only on sensing someone close by. These serves as aesthetic and environment- friendly options.</p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/03.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Independent Elements:</b> Though you may not think of it often, the bathroom is a space that you can decorate with a number of independent elements. Rather than have all your towels tucked away in a drawer, you may want to have open faced shelving options on the vanity. </p><p>You may also consider a shelf over the toilet area. This can hold books, for those who cannot be separated from them no matter what. It can also hold some scented candles, and knick knacks that you may want for guests to take a while and observe. </p><p>Art work is another element that most people don\u2019t think of. Often you find that bathrooms have blank walls, especially around the vanity area that are just screaming for attention. This is where you can display some really interesting art work. Small frames arrangement in a random manner can brighten up the dullest of spaces. </p><p>Shower curtains are another aspect that most people don\u2019t often think of. Rather than go with the boring white or solid color ones, you should consider something with more personality. There are so many curtain choices today some with 3D images that can add quite a bit of character and drama to your bathroom. The range available suits every kind of bathroom. </p><p><strong>These are just some of the considerations you may want to keep in mind when working on upgrading your bathroom. Work with your designer so that you get the best of elements and blend them together creating the perfect space.</strong></p>",

    "blog_content": "<b>Expert Speak:</b> Winning the lottery can be the perfect way to indulge yourself in all those d\u00e9cor elements that you thought were out of your reach. Here is how you can make the most of it. </p><p>Winning the lottery can mean different things to different people. While some would think of repaying debts, others would think of investing in homes. Yet a few others would think of giving their homes a complete make-over and invest in a few d\u00e9cor aspects that may seem indulgent but definitely right. May we suggest some of the ideas below to help you along your indulgent way?</p><p><b>For your living room:</b> This is the space in your home where you lounge about with your family. It is also a space that you entertain in quite a bit. There is so much you can do in your <b>living room</b>. Let\u2019s start with the seating arrangements. Should you have a large bay window in your home, you can use this to create a window ledge seating and reading corner. If the space is large enough, you may even consider fitting in a flat screen TV for your viewing pleasure. There is nothing like feeling close to the outdoors, while enjoying the comfort of being indoors. </p><p>The Lazy Boy is another lovely addition to your space. This has universally been the one piece of furniture that most people vie for. The comfort, the ability to adjust its contours to suit your body and the sheer sense of indulgence that it allows you is unprecedented. Though expensive, it may be just the thing you needed. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/1.JESSE_front.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Moving on to the lighting fixtures in your room. A double height living room can definitely do with a chandelier. Now that you have won the lottery, this should be among the first things on your purchase list. Chandeliers are available in so many varieties \u2013 from old school, candle-light styled versions to modern day lighting fixtures set in metal. What\u2019s more, you may even choose one based on the level of maintenance you are willing to handle. Discuss the layout of your interiors with your designer before deciding whether exposed light or those with shades work better as a chandelier for you. </p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/03_21f86fb0-7473-4ee0-8366-3910e1379d07.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The chandelier is also an option to consider for your kitchen island or your dining table. In fact, dining room chandeliers are also available in models where you can control the light and even the height of the piece, giving you complete control over the ambient lighting in the space. </p><p>Of course, the living room furnishing is also an upgrade you can think of investing in. A complete overhaul in this department can ensure a great new look for your space. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/BULBUL_Straight_Kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>The Kitchen:</b> If you win the lottery, your <b>kitchen interior</b> is definitely going to be on the cards for a complete overhaul. The natural place to start with is your cabinets. Most of us believe that basic wood and metal finishes are by far the only things we can do with cabinets. Fact is, there are several other high-end materials that you can consider for the under-mount of your sink, the panelling of cabinets, the backsplash area and the island and of course, the flooring. Some expensive materials you may consider for each of these elements are porcelain pebble, white marble, granite and the like. The use of these materials will instantly give your kitchen a glamorous upgrade. </p><p>You may also want to consider a complete change of theme for your kitchen. Going rustic would mean a lot of wood-based finishes. If you would rather go the contemporary way, you might want to go with a completely stainless steel finish to the kitchen. This is one approach that remains universal in appeal and timeless in terms of trends. </p><p>Winning a lottery is also the time you may want to consider making additions to your kitchen that were not there. Including an island with storage space, extending a kitchen leg to make a peninsula and a dining area or simply creating a breakfast nook in your kitchen. There is just so much that can be done. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/1.joey_front_sandoak.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Wardrobes:</b> Just like you will always want a larger kitchen, so too unlimited wardrobe space is what you must be dreaming of. A windfall in terms of a lottery can mean a whole new approach to your wardrobes. If you have the space to consider a walk-in <b>wardrobe</b>, now would be the good time to indulge in it. Alternately, space for specific elements of your <b>wardrobe </b>may also be something you are looking for. Perhaps a shelving set-up for your shoes, or a large hanger space for your saris and suits. </p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/classic-_front_view.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Each of your rooms could also do with some great artwork. While you may of course think of investing in the great names of the industry, this would be the perfect time to check out of the work of new age artists and those who work in digital art besides the common mediums of the form. You will be surprised at the range and beauty of what you will find. </p><p><strong>So if the dream of winning the lottery does come true, you know what you can do with it all.</strong></p>",

Here are some tips that will ensure you have a productive and gorgeous space to work out of.</p><p>Working from home is quite the norm these days. It makes so much more sense than battling traffic and arriving at office tired and drained. That apart, there are a number of start-ups that often begin and continue to function from a home office space. Setting up one such area in your home where you can comfortably work out of, yet conduct meetings in a professional environment is not as difficult as you would image it to be. Working with your designer and with a few basic thoughts in mind can help you create a fabulous working set up.</p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/02_646447a6-be20-42ce-80e5-036d47d4f09a.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br> Here are some ways to go about it:</p><p><strong>Open and Bright:</strong> Many people love to go with minimal and clean lines. This would mean having ample sunlight coming into your space \u2013 from skylights or from large bay windows. It provides you with a means of bringing the outdoors in. Many people have their home offices created at the top or the bottom most levels of their homes. If you have the option of having your home office open out to a larger space such as a balcony or a garden, do opt for it \u2013 this gives you the option of working al-fresco and even conducting open air meetings. Create nice cubby holes with a table and chair and an open umbrella and you have a great set up going.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/products/1.Markus_Front_White_Weinrot.jpeg?v=1447064652\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Centralized Storage:</strong> A home office is a space that has to be self-contained and which caters to every need of an office. Having a central storage unit or <strong>wardrobe </strong>fitted to cater to an office will help. A compact one will ensure that you have space to store books, magazines, files as well all your equipment like scanners, printers, copiers and other large items.</p><p>An office to fit two people could be created in such a way that two people occupy two ends of a long table, with all that they need in between them. This allows for complete privacy when working and yet offers the ease of sharing resources.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/Simone_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Color Schemes:</strong> This is an aspect that totally depends on the person using the office. While some prefer to have their offices stand completely apart from the rest of the home\u2019s d\u00e9cor, others prefer a cross-over.</p><p>Choose from a palette of colors that best describe your approach to work. Green is tranquil, blue is positive and shades of red aggressive. You may also want to bring in some greenery into your work space. If you are placed as an extension to your garden, then you could use plants to create a symmetry from your office to the open space. Alternately, you can choose from a range of indoor and outdoor plants to do up your office.</p><p><strong>Choosing your Work Table: </strong>This is a very important aspect of your home office. It is the one place that determines how productive you are going to be. There are a range of tables that you may consider. You may opt for one that is fixed to the wall, making the most of your space. This allows you to create storage space below, with the wall as your background. Independent racks of different sizes may be placed below it.</p><p>You may also choose to go with a single modular table that holds everything you need \u2013 from your printer to computer to shelving for your files and books. Alternately you may be interested in dividing up your office essentials on to a main and then a few <strong>side tables</strong>. The options are plenty and each depend on the space you have to work with.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/axel-front_view.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Personalize your working space: </strong>Your work space is a reflection of your personality. Don\u2019t treat it like a cubicle in a regular office. Personalize it with a tack board related work or your personal life. Bring in a lampshade on your <strong>table</strong> that may help you work late into the evenings or at night. Working alone and from home can sometimes be a lonely affair, get yourself a fish bowl and you will be surprised at how it brightens up your space. Let your imagination run wild as far as this aspect goes.</p><p><strong>Working with a Small Space:</strong> Sometimes a home office will have only a space amount of space dedicated to it. In such cases, it would be great to go with wall-mounted furniture options. You may also want to consider a completely glass wall or bay windows that bring in massive sunlight. A modular working space where everything you need is within arm\u2019s distance will help you make the most of a small space.</p><p>These are just some of the ways in which you can work your home office space.

There are many ways to make the most of your space and double the use of every element you include. </p><p>A home is a home no matter its size. You will want to do it up in the best possible way and make sure that you use every inch of it in a suitable manner. If your home has a small living space, fear not, there is still so much that you can do with it. </p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/2_4de94e11-4a30-41a2-92ac-533171748f49.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Built-in Furniture:</b> Make the most of built-in furniture. This can be for your shelves, cabinets, and even your sofas. If you can integrate them into your walls, with the appropriate design, then you will save on a great deal of floor space. If needed, you can take cabinets and shelves all the way to the ceiling. This gives you additional storage space as well as lovely little cubby holes to fill with the right kind of curios and accessories. Consider including a mix of open shelves and those that may be hidden behind mirrors. Such reflective surfaces give a room the feeling of being much larger than it is. It is also a great way to reflect natural sunlight all around the room. </p><strong><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/products/5_1600_Side_Open.jpg?v=1454311219\" alt=\"\"><br><br></strong></strong><p><b>Multi-purpose furniture: </b>No matter what furniture you bring into your living room, make sure that it serves more than one purpose. A freestanding book shelf for example, can serve as a room divider as well as a place to store your books. A sofa can be a pull out bed or have storage space below the cushions. A single futon serves as a great way to relax, and will open up to accommodate a guest at night. Your designers will give you several ideas to choose from. Make your coffee table count and choose a glass one with multiple shelves. This way, books, magazines and even a flower vase will find ample space. </p><strong><strong><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/4_d5f3f6a8-267b-4e8a-99fa-37aabc29042b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong><p><b>Fill up the odd spaces:</b> If you have spaces in your living room, you can consider filling it up in many ways. For example, the space between two chairs can have a small trunk instead of a table. This way, you use both the inside and the outside. A trunk or a refurbished box also adds an aesthetic touch to your space. An odd corner can have a customized shelf that fits into the corner and can take not just books and knick-knacks but also a lamp to illuminate the space. Use the space behind your sofas. This is especially if they are not backed up against the wall. This can be used to place a table with drawers and even pull out bins below. The amount of storage space you get is immense. </p><p>If your living room connects with a staircase then you will have a good amount of space placed below it. Use this in multiple ways. Fit in a small nook for your little ones to play and read in. Or, you could create an entertainment space with a customized modular unit built to house a bar. Alternately, you can create an indoor garden or even use the full space for an aquarium. </p><strong></strong> <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/products/3.Egon_BR_Front_Black_white.jpeg?v=1447064515\" alt=\"\"><p><b>Use the Walls:</b> \u00a0If you have small living room, you will want to stick to minimalism, yet ensure that the space does not lack anything. This is where technology comes into play. Rather than have an entertainment unit, you could consider wall mounting your TV and radio speakers. A dedicated space on your bookshelf can serve to hold radio units and TV boxes. This helps save on space and make your space look neater and more linear. \u00a0</p><p>Many small homes combine a living and a dining space. If you are looking to save space here, you can consider wall-mounting a dining table that can be pulled down when needed. To double up its utility, you may consider building in shelves at the bottom of the shelf, so that when it is up, it serves an aesthetic and utilitarian purpose. </p><p>A small living room does not mean that you do not get to decorate it the way you would like. All it needs is some ingenuity to blend together aesthetics and utility. A great designer will help you make some great additions to your space. </p>",

Don\u2019t make this is a one-man mission where you empty her room of all that you feel doesn\u2019t need to be there. Instead, allow your daughter to decide what she would like to keep and what she would like to give-away or discard. You will be surprised at how giving most young girls are. </p><p>If you find yourself with a small box filled with knick knacks, you could consider making a pictorial wallpaper \u2013 filled with milestones from her life.

If your little girl has not yet outgrown her love for pink, you could consider varying shades to add depth to the room. Alternately you could pick out a whole new range of shades to work with. Contrasting walls perhaps, or just <b>paint</b> 2 of 4 walls, leaving space for a handcrafted wallpaper like your pictorial one. Perhaps some textures to the <b>paint</b> as well. Or if your young girl is talented, she could use the wall as her own canvas. </p><p>Work on the furniture. No longer do you need animal print study tables and single units that combine desks and chairs. As your child grows, she will need a more ergonomically designed work area and bookshelf. Consider investing in modular units that best fit the space you have. Invest in good quality chairs for your daughter\u2019s room. She will need it to improve posture and maintain the discipline and sitting at her desk while working. </p><p>The floor is an additional space that you will want to work on.

If you have an empty corner, place a soft <b>rugs</b>, a bean bag and a freestanding light along with a small shelf at sitting level. This can work to be her personal space to read, relax or simply spend some time. </p><p>While all of this goes to upgrading a room from being kiddie to that of a young lady, there are several other ways you can work on personalizing a teenage girl\u2019s bedroom. For example:</p><ul><li ><p>Make a large ornate mirror a part of the d\u00e9cor. Besides giving the room a bigger feel, it allows her to preen at any time.</p> </li><li ><p>Work on lighting fixture. Rather than have a bedside lamp, you may want to randomly place strips of LED lights. In fact, these may even be used over posters to highlight them. Come festive season, these can easily be rearranged to ring in the festival cheer.</p> </li><li ><p>There are a number of customized stickers that you can create based on themes for your teenager\u2019s room. This can be used on cupboard and balcony doors, on walls and even on the ceiling. These can easily be peeled away and replaced with something new with each passing year. </p></li><li ><p>Make sure to segregate the work and play (or preen) area. It is very easy for a youngster to get distracted and so creating two distinct corners, with their own personalities will help. </p></li></ul><p>Transforming a young child\u2019s room into that of teenager is all about a joint effort. Once you have a concept in mind, that pleases your young lady, you can easily execute it and watch your daughter grow up in a space that she will completely love. </p>",

    "blog_content": "<b>Expert Speak:</b> Everyone wants to own home that makes a lasting impression on visitors. That home can be yours with these tips. </p>\r<p><strong>When you have guests visiting, you go out of your way to ensure that your home is clean and that you have a great spread placed before them to enjoy. You leave no stone unturned to ensure that everyone who visits your home enjoys themselves and takes back memories of time spent in a beautiful home. But, if you are wondering if there are better ways to make a great first impression, here are some tips to help. </strong></p>\r<p><b>Start with the outside:</b> Many of us pay so much of attention to the inside of our homes that we forget that our guests come in from the outside. Making an impression begins from here. Step outside your home and talk a walk up to your front door. Look at ways to tidy up the walkway. Once done with that, you should try and pretty up the space. Add in a series of planters with flowering plants to make your entryway look good. </p>\r<p><strong>Invest in a good looking door and not just a functional one. Let the design be in line with the d\u00e9cor you have on the inside of your home. A traditionally carved door for ethnic d\u00e9cor or a more modernistic design for a contemporary home. The use of innovative door handles, knockers and knobs will add to the beauty of your entrance. </strong></p>\r<p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/products/5.006_1200_FYR_s1_int.jpg?v=1454312824\" alt=\"\"></strong></p>\r<p>\u00a0</p>\r<p><strong><b>The Foyer:</b> This is a space that is invariably built into the design of a home. If this is where you will stow away shoes, invest in a good shoe cabinet. Use the top of this for a flower pot or an aquarium. Consider adding in a painting on the wall, with a spotlight to emphasize it if needed. You may also want to include a large mirror over the entryway to the first room of the house. This mirror, when facing the front door, will reflect light and give a sense of expanse. A great way to welcome a guest. </strong></p>\r<p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/4_03608812-dcb8-4cf8-8920-3c0af5b8c1a8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r<p><b>The Living Room:</b> This is usually the first room that you welcome a guest into. Cleanliness is of course the first thing to look into. Besides that, you may want to give your guest something interesting to look at \u2013 perhaps a great collection of coffee table books, or better yet, a gallery wall. If your guest is visiting for the first time, this can be a fantastic ice breaker and a point of conversation. </p>\r<p>Ensure that you create a soothing ambience in your living room when you have guests visiting. Aromatherapy candles in a discreet corner, ample sunlight, mood lighting for the evenings etc., are great ways of showcasing your home at different times of the day. </p>\r<p><b>The Corridors:</b> If you have corridors leading to different parts of your home, you may want to add some life to them. A series of interconnected paintings perhaps. Or an interesting set of light fixtures can help bring dull corridors to life. You may also use each corridor to create picture galleries of different members of your family. The best part of an effort like this is that you will always find new material to update the images with and offer those visiting something new to see each time. </p>\r<p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/5_1854c153-d2b6-4703-b780-cf9f2f8953c7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r<p><b>Interesting Furnishing:</b> While the furniture across your home will be in keeping with the d\u00e9cor theme, it is the small things that can make a world of difference. The soft furnishing elements of your home, can go a long way in making a great impression. Let\u2019s start with your doorway. A good quality, yet artistic doormat is an instant. </p>\r<p>Little bouquets of potpourris or pots of plants across your home will leave a pleasant feeling. The same goes with little lamps and aromatic candles. In your bathroom, rather the go in for run-of-the-mill shower curtains, you may want to pick up some with some interesting printed designs. The range available is mind-boggling. Get creative with the storage in your kitchen \u2013 use glass bottles for impact. In your bathrooms, introduce a small bookshelf or a set of curios. This goes a long way in ensuring that the space is not just functional, but aesthetic as well. </p>\r<p><strong>Getting rid of all the clutter in your home is also a simple way of ensuring a clean home and one that reflects your personality perfectly. You will be surprised at how it is the small things that go a long way in making a lasting impression. So go ahead, implement some of these ideas and let your guests leave with some great thoughts on your home. </strong></p>",

These islands come in a range of sizes and may be used in multiple ways to add utility to a kitchen. If you like the idea of having an island in your kitchen there are a few things you will need to keep in mind when making a choice. Here are some questions you need to figure out:</p><p><strong>Functionality:</strong> The first thing you need to figure out is the functionality of your island in your modular kitchen design. Do you want it for additional cooking space, to put in a sink or perhaps just as a dining table option. There are several ways in which you may also achieve a combination of all of these requirements. Understanding the purpose it serves, will give you an idea on how big your island must be and whether you kitchen can actually accommodate it.</p><p><strong>Integrating Appliances:</strong> You may want to use your kitchen island to integrate all of your large appliances. In that case, your designer will have to think of modular storage options and well as drawing power lines to the center of the kitchen. You may consider making it a completely functional space by including your sink, the trash bins and some storage space for your appliances, all in one compact space.</p><p><strong>Additional Storage:</strong> The great thing about an island in <strong>kitchen designs</strong> is that it can be utilized in multiple ways. In a large L-shaped kitchen, the island may simply serve as a storage unit. Each wall of the unit can be uniquely designed to accommodate a variety of things. You may also have pull-out shelves for large appliances. The counter-top may be used to lay out a meal or simply as a space to dine at.</p><p><strong>Height of the Island:</strong> The height of your island is determined by what you are going to use it for. Remember that its height can affect the entire look of your kitchen. Ideally have your interior designer look through the space and ascertain what best may work for your kitchen. Based on the dimensions available you may have to tailor the design of the island a bit.</p><p>A kitchen island is a great way to add a dimension to the utility and <strong>designs of kitchen</strong>. Its flexibility lends it to multiple uses.</p>",

You will find several ways to incorporate it into your d\u00e9cor to give your home a seamless look.</p><p>One of the fundamental principles of interior design is to have a seamless flow of thought from one room to another. You will notice that there are elements that carry over to another room to bring in a sort of connect. These little elements are subtle in their presence and work at creating a distinctly unique look for your home.</p><p>Take the popular <strong>L-shaped</strong> <strong>modular kitchen</strong>. Now, this is a kitchen design that works well in a largish home that has the space to accommodate it.

This gives you a great way to bring in organized greenery while subtly highlighting the concept of L in the d\u00e9cor of your home. The benches you place here may also be L-shaped.</p><p><strong>Living Room:</strong> An interesting way to bring the L-shape into your living room is to go with an L-shaped sofa set.

It may also have additional storage space or a built-in pull-out bed that you may consider using. Enhance these with angular shelves on your walls for books.</p><p><strong>Empty Corners:</strong> Most homes end up with an empty corner at some place.

It is flexible enough to be a study table, coffee corner or a mini-bar.</p><p><strong>L-Shaped Islands:</strong> Coming back to your kitchen, you may consider including an L-shaped island.

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak:</strong> A straight kitchen has a specific logic behind its design that will help you make the most of the space. This article helps you organize your straight kitchen for maximum benefit.</p><p>A <strong>straight kitchen design</strong> is the perfect answer to a small kitchen space. It provides utility without creating any unusable space in your kitchen. The design is always functional and linear ensuring everything you need is a small distance away. If you have a straight modular kitchen planned for your home, here are some tips on how you can increase the storage space that you have.</p><p>Organizing your straight storage space needs you to take a step back and think practically. The smaller design can leave you feeling that you do not have enough of space to work with. That is not so. Try and look at your kitchen from one end to another. You may begin with the placement of your fridge. This will naturally take up one corner of the straight kitchen and that is naturally sorted out.</p><p>From this point you need to organize your shelves based on your usage of products and foods while cooking. Here is how:</p><p><strong>Foods for consumption:</strong> Stand in the middle of your straight kitchen and look at your drawer options. It is best to place ready-to-eat foods in the top cabinets, to the left and right of your head. You may also consider using one of the lowest pull-out bins \u2013 either side or the middle as per your convenience. By force of habit, these are the spots you tend to reach out when looking for a snack.</p><p><strong>For Crockery and Large Appliances:</strong> These need to be placed a little away from your cooking area. Choose the large, single door shelf on either side of this modular kitchen set-up. This ensures that no matter which side of the kitchen you are working on, your vessels will not be too far away.</p><p><strong>Prep Work Essentials:</strong> When you get down to cooking you need to have all your essentials within arm\u2019s reach. For this, work your way inwards with the shelving options placed below. Use the two large drawers to the right of the gas stove, or to the left depending on how you like to work. You can also consider adding in a <strong>kitchen fittings</strong> like wall mounted rack for easy reach of spice boxes.</p><p><strong>Cleaning and Cooking:</strong> Ensure that your cleaning and cooking spaces are clearly demarcated and placed a good distance away from each other to prevent cross contamination of any sort.</p><p>With these few basics in straight <strong>kitchen storage</strong>, you will be able to make the most of your kitchen, no matter how small it seems.</p>",

In fact, this is a model of kitchen often opted for in larger homes as well, to facilitate the accommodation of a dining space. There are several ways to stylize your straight kitchen. Here are some ideas to inspire you:</p><p><strong>Save Space:</strong> If you are looking to include a straight kitchen in a small space, you will want to make the most of storage. Have your cabinets, ideally a mix of closed and open, go all the way up your wall. This way, you can store larger vessels and those you don\u2019t use regularly, higher up. You may also consider creating wall-mounted options for your larger <strong>kitchen appliances</strong>. Another option, would be to build space for appliances into your straight kitchen cabinetry. This would probably work if you live alone or are a new couple setting up home.</p><p><strong>Create a Galley:</strong> A straight kitchen may also be introduced into a large space. In such cases you may consider adding in a kitchen island to help create a triangle for working \u2013 cleaning, prepping and cooking. It also forms a galley where you can walk down a corridor of sorts, adding to the charm of your kitchen.</p><p><strong>Go Sleek:</strong> The benefit of a straight <strong>modular kitchen design</strong> is that it occupies a minimal amount of space. That being said you may work your space to look glamorous and sleek. For example, consider interspersing empty space between each part of your triangular work area. This you can use to decorate your kitchen or simply to give you more space to maneuver. Bring in a low hanging light or one that you can alter in terms of height to change the look of your kitchen space.</p><p><strong>Go Artistic:</strong> Turn your straight kitchen into a quirky space of art and craft. Bring in artistic elements with the kitchen as a theme and watch it all come to life. This works especially well if you have a lot of natural light coming into the kitchen. Alternately you may consider adding in-cabinet lights or small light fixtures to do up your space.</p><p>The straight kitchen is often perceived as a <strong>modular kitchen</strong> that has little scope for manipulation. Fact is, sky is the limit when it comes to designing this space.</p>",

Here are some thoughts on how you can settle on the ideal kitchen island seating options:</p><p><strong>Assess How Your Kitchen is Utilized:</strong> You will first need to understand the kind of traffic in your kitchen.

If you tend to have a lot of visitors pop in at all times, you may need enough of space to accommodate them while you cook. Alternately, if yours is a kitchen where you tend to work in isolation and only have people come in to eat on occasion, a flexible, but small seating option is all you need.</p><p><strong>Evaluate Various Island Seating Options:</strong> There are numerous kinds of seating options \u2013 one sided, two sided or simply seating at two ends of the island. Some islands offer you the options of seating on only one corner while another may allow for seating on three sides. Based on your evaluation of the traffic and general pattern of movement in your kitchen you will be able to choose an option that works best for you.</p><p><strong>Kinds of Seats:</strong> There are three main kinds of kitchen island seating options \u2013 counter, chair or bar stool levels. Each of these may be placed at different heights. Your choice will depend on the people that come into your space and their comfort. Besides personal comfort, each of these options also helps you conserve space in different ways, enhancing the benefits of your particular choice. You may also consider bringing in simple stools. These may be stashed away or taken to other parts of the house to provide multi-seating options elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Kitchen layout</strong> and island seating is a simple matter that requires a bit of forethought. Charting out the way forward with your interior designer can also make a world of difference to how you utilize your kitchen.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak:</strong> The L-shaped kitchen is a basic design that lends itself to several variations. This provides it a flexibility which every end user may use to their benefit.</p><p>Over the years, the average home has evolved. While every room in the house has its own specific function, many a time you see an overlap. The bedroom doubles up to a living space; the study comes with an attached gym and today, the kitchen is a place for socialization. As far as modular kitchen designs go, the L-shaped kitchen is by far the most popular. Interior designers have been able to manipulate the design to suit various aesthetic and practical needs. If you are in the process of planning your kitchen, here are some of the benefits of the <strong>L-shaped kitchen</strong>:</p><p><strong>The Perfect Work Triangle: </strong>The L-shaped modular kitchen keeps in mind the perfect work triangle equation. It is what makes this model the most efficient. A good work triangle allows you to easily maneuver between your prepping, cooking and cleaning areas. It also ensures that there is no overlap at all and that everything you need is close on hand.</p><p><strong>Several Entryways: </strong>The good thing about <strong>kitchen design in L-shape</strong> is that it is usually placed in recesses of the walls, which means it does not leave any dead spots. It makes use of all the space there is to utilize, thus giving you more room to accommodate people who want to help in the kitchen or simply hang out. Adding in an island also creates a galley, which works to streamline the traffic in your kitchen ensuring that nobody gets in the way.</p><p><strong>Open Living Spaces: </strong>Modern designs emphasize open living spaces. An L-shaped kitchen makes use only two walls, allowing for a good amount of space for all the traffic that you anticipate in the kitchen. It also allows you to create an open kitchen that can flow seamlessly into a separate dining space. Even the d\u00e9cor of your L-shaped kitchen may be created keeping in mind the rest of your house. You may have your kitchen completely stand out, or blend it in with the rest of the house. <br>The <strong>L-shaped kitchen interior design</strong> allows you to go with the times. It is a basic design that allows for a great deal of flexibility depending on what you place importance on. The legs of the L as well as the storage space included may be altered to suit a family\u2019s specific needs and this is what makes it a great modular kitchen design option.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak:</strong> <em>Long door handles are an excellent choice for wardrobes because they provide a natural grip, lend an aesthetic appeal and follow the laws of Physics.</em></p><p>People go about using wardrobes without paying much attention to one of its most useful operational components - the door handle. The humble door handle has been taken for granted forever and very few people actually give it the respect it deserves.</p><p>Handles come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny pull knobs to designer pieces with highly contoured shapes. However, as far as functionality is concerned, there is usually one class of wardrobe door handles that stand out from the rest. These are the ones that are long and provide a natural grip.</p><p>What makes long handles the best choice for wardrobes?</p><ol><li><p><strong>Ease of operation:</strong> Evolution has over millions of years, given human beings the hands that they find so useful today. Long door handles can be easily used by people with any finger type - thick, slim, fat, short or long. There is ample action space between the door and the actual handle and this prevents your fingers from getting stucky while opening or closing the door.</p></li><li><p><strong>Follows laws of Physics:</strong> Long door handles have a greater hold on the door which means lesser force is needed to be applied to open them. Generally, wardrobe doors have a magnetic lock or some other locking mechanism which prevents the door from not closing properly or staying open. These mechanisms may be quite strong in some cases. A long door handle allows a person to easily pull the door open as the surface area over which the handle is installed is greater. Try pulling opening a large door with a small knob and it will give you a good idea of what we are talking about.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplicity of design:</strong> Simple geometric design provides a greater aesthetic appeal \u2013 this is the kind of premise around which long handles are designed. The main handle bar could be cylindrical, cuboid, hexagonal prism or any other type. The advantage of such a simple design is not only its visibility, but also the ease with which they blend into the d\u00e9cor.</p><p>\u00a0</p></li></ol><p><em>On a lighter note, most of us would have used a door handle on a wardrobe to hang things at some point of time or the other. Without going into the context of whether it\u2019s a right thing to do or not, the advantage of a long door handle is pretty clear.</em></p>",

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak: </strong>Ideally a wardrobe is considered a boring piece of furniture. The uneventful custodian of your precious clothes and all other knick knacks those are dear to you. Would you not like the wardrobe to be more than a drab object in the corner of your room\u2026 more than just a storage unit? That\u2019s what the experts think. Among all furniture, wardrobes probably have the highest utility quotient and a comparatively lower aesthetic value. Modern home makers today, however, look for wardrobes that are a combination of both; wardrobes that can put a smile on their face every time.</p><p>One such smile-worthy solution can be found in mirrored wardrobes, with sliding doors. When designed to cover the breadth of one wall in the room, with sleeker compartment space, these can add beautifully to the aesthetics of your living space. To ensure that these wardrobes snugly fit into your room, they are made according to the overall height and width of the actual aperture you wish to install the wardrobe into.</p><p><strong>Here are 5 ways in which mirror fa\u00e7ade wardrobes with sliding doors can be a blessing:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Larger rooms beyond dimensions:</strong> Of course it\u2019s an optical illusion, but mirrors can do wonders in making your room look bigger. Be it natural lighting or artificial, if the wardrobes are placed along the largest wall, the room can be tricked into looking double its actual size.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Maximum space utility.</strong> Since these wardrobes cover the breadth of a wall, the depth can be kept minimal with ideal compartment sizes. Sliding doors further reduce the use of floor space at all times. This increases your room\u2019s floor space. A room that is less stuffy is naturally good for uplifting your spirits. This gives you enough space in the room for walking around, or decorating with a carpet for floor works, or even a dance or zumba practice stage! You have the studio like wall mirror already; why not make the best out of it!</p></li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Light, light everywhere!</strong> Again, with large mirrors, the room looks brighter. Placed at right angles to natural lighting and you can maximize the amount of light in the room beautifully. Bright room = happy people!</p></li></ol><ol start=\"4\"><li><p><strong>Hassle free access:</strong> sliding doors, unlike hinged doors, provide easy access to all sections of the wardrobe, without having to open and close multiple compartments. And since there aren\u2019t any swinging doors to tackle, you can reach every nook and cranny with ease.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"5\"><li><p><strong>Personalized fa\u00e7ade designs:</strong> Not unlike wood, mirrored sliding doors have multiple styling and personalizing options too. You can choose plain full size mirrors with trims, tracks or panels. You can also look at lacquered glass, colored glass, shaded glass, partly frosted mirrors, or a combination of styles to suit your taste.</p></li></ol><p>We believe in showering compliments, be it to a beautiful woman or gifted chef! The receivers are always happy and always reciprocate with perks. Well, choosing the right furniture is like complimenting your home. And the perk is - waking up to a beautiful house that gives you a sense of accomplishment. Try it!</p>",

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak:</strong> <em>The color white survives all trends and remains a good choice for furniture because of its ability to blend in with any kind of d\u00e9cor.</em></p><p>For a lot of people, plain white furniture is akin to an unfinished canvas, desperately awaiting a coat of bright paint. White wardrobes are never their first choice of furniture because they are afraid of getting it stained. This medieval thinking not only limits their choice but also keeps them from opening the doors of ultimate sophistication in their bedroom.</p><p>Here is why a white wardrobe is perfect for trendsetters:</p><p><strong>Can blend with any d\u00e9cor:</strong> Everybody, including you, owns a pair of black shoes. Why? Simple. Because it goes with everything!! Having a white wardrobe follows the same logic. It is so pure and simple that it can easily blend in with any kind of d\u00e9cor. It doesn\u2019t overpower any element of your room; in fact, it subtly improves it.</p><p><strong>Induces peaceful sleep:</strong> Modern lifestyle makes everyone suffer from attention deficit disorder, only exception being Buddhist monks. Now, who wouldn\u2019t like a moment of quiet to restore some sanity and bring some order in their lives. Let your tired eyes rest on the serenity of a white wardrobe. It can have a calming effect on your stressed mind and induce a Zen like state.</p><p><strong>Increases the brightness:</strong> If your apartment is low on light, a white wardrobe can be a good solution. One of the biggest advantages of white in a room is that light bounces off it and creates an optical illusion of space. White walls or furniture can have an expanding effect on a room and make it look a lot more brighter and livable.</p><p><em><strong>Timeless Classic:</strong> Trends change more frequently than seasons. There was a time when pale colors were all the rage and everyone had them everywhere. Wooden textures appeal to the hipster generation today while soft polishes were preferred just a few years ago. The trends can be expected to shift from metallic neons to matt tones, but white has been and will always remain a classic. The timeless appeal of the color is simply unparalleled.</em></p>",

Modular furniture promises a combination of style and flexibility. Here are some of the advantages of a modular wardrobe.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Uses Space Efficiently</strong>: With skyrocketing real estate prices, it would be a shame to waste even an inch of your new apartment. That is why we design modular wardrobes that eliminate wastage and judiciously use every square inch of your apartment. Since these wardrobes come in parts, they can efficiently use every nook and cranny of your bedroom.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"2\"><li><p><strong>Can be configured for any need</strong>: Space needs for a couple with two kids are going to be different from the ones who are single and can live out of a suitcase. Modular wardrobes allow you to accommodate all kinds of storage needs. If you are a power dresser, you can have extra rails fitted in your wardrobe to give your expensive suits more room to breathe or if you are borderline obsessive about cleanliness, you can have more shelves in your wardrobe to organize your bedroom better.</p></li></ol><ol start=\"3\"><li><p><strong>Easy installation:</strong> Perhaps the biggest advantage of a modular wardrobe is the relative ease with which it can be installed. No more heavylifiting or figuring out the perfect tilt axis, no more hiring 6 labourers and wasting an entire day to put it in the right place. It can be installed in a few hours, saving you a lot of your productive time.</p></li></ol><p><em>You\u2019ve bought a home you love. At myGubbi, we design furniture you deserve.</em></p>",

Ideal for small bedrooms and solo living, the Gambel wardrobe is designed to enhance the spaciousness of your bedroom.</p><p>Every once in while we come across requests to deck up a small bedroom. Modern homes these days are all about achieving high quality style and class in limited spaces. It is in fact an art and a special privilege for our designers to cater to our modern day home owners. Wardrobes are a critical element in these <b>bedroom designs </b>and can add a lot of value towards enhancing the space of your bedroom. </p><p>There are two major guidelines to follow when planning<b> wardrobe designs</b> for small bedrooms: </p><ol><li><p> Minimize the space occupied - More of a physical and practical guideline.</p></li><li><p> Maximize the space visible - \u00a0More on the lines of creating an illusion. </p></li></ol><p>On those guidelines, here are 3 simple ways in which your wardrobes can magically make your room look spacious.</p><ol><li><p><b> Structure - Sleek and Classic:</b> occupying more of the bedroom height than the floor is a great way to begin. When faced with space crunch, always choose sleeker wardrobes that tend to stand tall and occupy lesser floor space. It always helps to own wardrobes that have classic and clean cuts. heavy trims or contours can make the piece bulkier and appear to occupy more space. </p></li><li><p><b> Sliding Doors </b>- This really doesn't need further explanation. Sliding doors on your wardrobe are practically the best space savers. </p></li><li><p><b> Mirrors and Reflective surfaces </b>- light has a direct influence on the room's space. It doesn't really matter if the room is blessed with natural lighting or is decked with a combination of artificial ones. Light shades of colors or even white as in the case of myGubbi's Gambel Wardrobe, are great for enhancing the illusion of space. Of course, reflective surfaces in the form of mirrors or laminations, exponentially enhance the room's lighting and add to the space value of the bedroom as well. </p></li></ol><p><b>Storage Solution</b></p><p>Small spaces should not mean that our young users cannot buy clothes and accessories to their heart's content. It is indeed unfair and even rude to let go of a beautiful blouse just because you think your wardrobe might explode. All you need are small tricks and hacks that can convert even a small wardrobe to house a large collection of fashionable goodies!</p><p><b>Shelving space above the wardrobe </b>can be used to tuck away your suitcases and other rarely used items.  <strong><b>Smart organizing within the</b> <b>wardrobe</b> can accommodate almost double the number of items than what would visually seem possible. A combination of shelves to stack items, multiple rods placed one above the other, drawers or utility boxes for knick knacks are all useful organizing tricks for maximum space utilization within the wardrobe. The Gambel Wardrobe here portrays a great example of how shelves, floor space and multiple rods can help organize maximum items.</strong></p>",

    "blog_content": "<b>Expert Speak: </b>MDFs are a cost effective solution in modern day homes, for owners who look for comfort, functionality and design all bundled together.</p><p>We\u2019re often consulted about the benefits of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboards) and are usually questioned about our preference of MDF over solid ply wood. Traditionally, when it comes to strength, sturdiness and durability, solid plywood is considered the ideal solution for your wardrobe. Plywood is also revered for its beautiful grains and natural tones. </p><p>However, when we talk about those qualities being catering to a contemporary audience, the MDF appears as a surprisingly good hero. Here are three ways how the hero shines. </p><b><li><p><b>Shrinkage / Expansion: </b>Solid wood contracts and expands when subjected to changes in humidity and heat. Especially when it comes to the Indian context, we\u2019ve often noted the troubles of ill fitting doors during monsoons. We\u2019ve heard of cases where users chip off pieces of the door\u2019s edges only to find it shrunken and when the season turns. </p></li></b><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p>MDF in such cases performs better than plywood. Being made of recycled wood fibers and resins, MDF is a high grade composite material that can tackle changes in weather conditions without any side effects. They\u2019re an automatic bonus for the construction team who can now incorporate seamless designs without having to leave breathing/ floating gaps. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><b><li><p><b>Maintenance: </b>The durability of a wooden wardrobe is always associated with high care and maintenance. What with the shrinkage / expansion, re-touching of top coats and even prevention from bug attacks. Now, these may not be frequent troubles, but with MDF these are non-existent. </p></li></b><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><b><li><p><b>Construction Feasibility: </b>MDF is usually readily available in much larger panel sizes (5\u2019 by 12\u2019 panels for example). This allows for flexibility in design and construction. Being a processed panel, they do not have natural grains on the surface which helps in joining panels. </p></li></b><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p>Don\u2019t get us wrong, natural grains and knots are beautiful if you have a traditional look in mind. But when catering to a modern day home, we are talking about colors and finishing that are contemporary. Grains and knots have been known to bleed through paints and stain coatings. This is where MDF becomes a designer\u2019s delight. </p><strong><strong></strong></strong><ol><li ><p><b>Design and Modification friendly</b>: Speaking of designer\u2019s delight, handling a material that can be molded in different forms only help our creative juices flow faster and better. MDFs can be transformed into little pieces of art when it comes to finishing. Pre Lam, Post Form Lam, Foil, Poly-Gloss, 5Pc, HG Lacquer and Acrylic Veneer are some of the finishes to be considered. All you need to do is pick your product and think of a look. A quick consultation with our designers for color options and end designs, and you get yourself a wardrobe like none other. \u00a0</p></li></ol><p><strong>MDFs are a cost effective solution for modern day homes, with owners who look for comfort, functionality and design all bundled together.

    "blog_content": "<b>Expert Speak: </b>Reflective surfaces and lighter shades are used while making contemporary furniture to enhance natural light because light is conducive to healthy living.</p><p>This is a given thumb rule of interior decor that Natural lighting is quite literally god's gift to a designer's palette. It goes a long way to ensure a healthy and happy household as well. The success lies, primarily, in the ways in which you achieve natural lighting in a room, and secondly in how you enhance it. For example, making a choice of the right <b>wardrobe designs</b> for your <b>bedroom</b>, goes a long way in working the lighting of a room. It isn't difficult to decide what the right furniture is when you have the talented designers of myGubbi ready to guide you. </p><p>Here are three main aspects of choosing the right wardrobe for your bedroom when enhanced natural lighting is your priority. </p><ol><li><p><b> Lighter shades brighten up space:</b> this is simple, light shades, preferably whites, off whites and pastels always enhance lighting in a room. Whether it's the color of the wall or the linen and curtains or even the wardrobes and furniture, lighter shades can brighten up a room. Take for example myGubbi's Quail Wardrobe. It fits in seamlessly with the interiors. </p></li><li><p><b> Mirrors and reflective surfaces:</b> among all bedroom furniture, wardrobes have the largest exposed surface area. Covering this area with reflective material such as mirrors or pastel shaded reflective surfaces helps natural light reflect and create a illusive brightness. Again, the Quail Wardrobe is a great example of this. It serves dual purpose - The head to toe mirror for vanity and the pastel blue reflective surface to bounce off the lights for aesthetics. </p></li><li><p><b> Clean and classic designs: </b>bulky wardrobes with multiple contours or trims and panels tend to form shadows in the overall look of the wardrobe. The functionality of a wardrobe doesn't improve with these patterns either. <b>Contemporary wardrobe designs</b> have clean lines, plain surfaces seamless connections to help the wardrobe blend in with the decor more. </p></li></ol><p>The following fourth aspect comes into play once you have chosen the wardrobe. </p><p><strong><b>4. Placement: </b>finding the right place for your <b>bedroom wardrobe</b> is also critical for enhancing natural lighting. Usually placing them perpendicular or slightly angled to the source of lighting (the window or the door) can enhance the room's lighting by double. This is especially helpful in smaller spaces that probably have just one window. </strong> \u00a0</p>",

This is mostly to create minimalistic designs that render comfort and class in one go. Following extensive research to gain product confidence we recommend a wall mounted wardrobe to our contemporary home owners. This is when we realize that there are inhibitions housed by the home owners about this wonderful piece of furniture and we though what better way to clear those doubts than to spell them out here!</p><p>Here are the 3 most common myths about a Wall Mounted Wardrobe:</p><p><b>Myth # 1. Wall mounted wardrobes are not sturdy and strong!</b></p><p><b>Truth:</b> cabinets and wardrobes are not just hung on nails and left for suspension like how you would a wall painting. These wardrobes are constructed on the wall with individual parts installed one after the other. These are fixed together while being nailed in and the support of the wall is utilized on all part of the structure. The right usage of material, such as in the case of MDF boards, would ensure that you have a non-bulky, sleek unit that can withstand a good amount of weight on its shelves. </p><p><b>Myth # 2: The bedroom wall will get destroyed and we cannot reuse it!</b></p><p><b>Truth: </b>The wardrobe is constructed on the wall, therefore, yes, there will be drill holes and shadows left once the wardrobe is dismounted. However, that doesn't render the wall useless. A simple re-plastering is all it would take for the wall to look brand new again. Also, when finalizing the decor and look of the bedroom, the wardrobe is thought of as a primary component. A wall once selected for the wardrobe, be it placed or wall mounted, is seldom ever changed. Therefore you need not bother about recurring costs and move ahead with wall mounts without hesitations.</p><p><b>Myth # 3: Wall mounted wardrobes cannot be big in size!</b></p><p>There's more to this myth, we've heard people complain about the fact that owing to its questionable sturdiness, wall mount units cannot be larger in size and they can only be considered for cabinets in kitchens and bathrooms. Now, everybody loves large wardrobes, so wall mounts are not considered a feasible option. </p><p><b>Truth: </b>To begin with, myGubbi has a live example to prove this myth wrong in its very unique and beautiful \u00a0Pheasant Wardrobe! With this full size wardrobe - eight feet in height, nine feet in width and 2 feet in depth - you won't get a better myth breaker! When it comes to sturdiness, our note on myth # 1 should have helped in clearing doubts. However, you also get to consult our experts to get further information. </p><strong>Aesthetically these floating units create a magical feel to the space in your room. A wall mounted wardrobe would both free up space and add to the illusion of more space all at once. </strong>",

A number of hotel rooms suites around the world use some form of wardrobe lighting to help guests find their clothes without turning lights on everywhere in the room. Now you can have the same experience in your own bedroom.</p><strong><strong></strong></strong><p>The most innovative lights are small and powerful, without being too bright. Modern LED lighting also makes the light appear milder while the bulbs don\u2019t overheat when on. Perhaps the best feature that could be included is a pair of motion sensors built into the wardrobe doors, that let the lights come on automatically when the doors are opened. </p><p><strong>Sometimes the lights are placed inside the wardrobe and sometimes on the outside. Nonetheless, these tiny lights solve a pressing issue when it comes to wardrobe design. While deep and wide wardrobes might be excellent for extra storage, they do tend to be really dark inside. \u00a0Having a light fixture on your wardrobe means you\u2019ll never have to fumble for your pair or jeans again.</strong></p>",

It suits a range of homes, making complete use of all the floor space that it takes up.</p><p>A parallel kitchen often seems rather plain for a modular kitchen. However, it packs in several benefits that you will see when you begin to use the space. This is a simple layout for a kitchen, but by far one of the most effective ones around. Here are some of the benefits for you to consider</p><p><strong>Practical layout:</strong> <strong>Parallel kitchen designs</strong> are also known as galley kitchen set ups and come with counters on opposite walls. These counters may be used according to your convenience for prepping, cooking and cleaning. Usually prep and cooking are placed on one side, and cleaning on the other. Irrespective of the size of the home, this kitchen gives ample space to maneuver for all those who choose to work in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>Ergonomically Effective:</strong> Parallel kitchens often take the least amount of space. This gives you additional space to work with for the rest of your home. Despite taking up less floor area, it in no way compromises on its efficiency. A parallel kitchen also gives you the benefit of going vertical with your cabinetry. This space may be used to store all your kitchen essentials from the smallest to the largest.</p><p><strong>Creative Freedom:</strong> The parallel kitchen model gives you a good deal of flexibility when it comes to designing your space. Choose to intersperse your overhead cabinetry with frosted glass or solid doors. For the storage space below the platforms you may choose to have modular pull-out units included. You may also mix up drawers and pull out bins for more flexible storage space.</p><p>Use the walls in myriad ways. You can choose to put up textured wallpaper to add character to your kitchen. You may also choose to include wall-mounted racks for your small daily requirements.</p><p><strong>Better Organizing Power:</strong> With a parallel kitchen you will have designated spots for everything you need. This will help you get better organized in the kitchen and work more efficiently. The space may be designed to include specific appliances that you need to store. You can also think of adding in a small peninsula, if space permits to get more out of your kitchen.</p><p>The parallel kitchen is a popular choice in modern day apartments as it provides ample work and storage space, without looking cluttered. Work with your interior designer to come up with<strong> parallel kitchen design ideas</strong> that works ideally for you.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak:</strong> The standard <strong>U-shaped kitchen design</strong> may be manipulated in multiple ways to accommodate your specific tastes in set up and aesthetics.</p><p>If you are looking for a wonderfully functional kitchen that conforms to any space that you place it in, the U-shaped kitchen is your answer. It ideally fits in the work triangle, ensuring that your refrigerator, sink and cook stove are all within arm\u2019s reach. All you have to do is pivot around to reach a section you are looking for. Here are some interesting layouts you can consider for your U-shaped kitchen:</p><p><strong>The Ideal Work Triangle:</strong> If you are looking for an efficient cooking space for your family, then create a <strong>U-shaped modular kitchen</strong> with the perfect work triangle. This is something that may be worked out even in a tight working space. Work with your designer to ensure that your bench top for prepping, the sink, and stove are at an ideal distance from each other. You may choose to include your fridge within the U or place it on an adjacent wall to get more maneuvering space.</p><p><strong>Go Glass:</strong> One of the ways to enhance the conventional U-shaped kitchen, irrespective of its size, is to work on the cabinetry. A standard U-shaped kitchen gives you overhead cabinets as well as those below. While solid door cupboards work ideally for those below, you may want to consider glass doors for the overhead cabinets. This gives your kitchen a beautiful look which may be further enhanced with in-cabinet lighting. Add in some alcove lighting for your counter tops and you will have an amazing kitchen to come home to everyday.</p><p><strong>Centralized Work Area: </strong>If you are working with a large kitchen space, you may want to consider playing around with the work area. You do not have to restrict it to only the legs of the U. How about bringing in a work island that can be utilized to prep as well as clean. Alternately you may use it to prep and to accommodate your family when dining. Such a layout adds immense character to your kitchen space.</p><p><strong>Placement of Appliances: </strong>One way in which to change the look of your <strong>U-shaped kitchen design</strong> from the standard set up is to have all your appliances placed on a single side of the kitchen. This allows you a lot of free space that you may use in any way that you would like to. You may also customize your storage space in this part of the kitchen to accommodate the accessories for each of your appliances.</p><p>These are just some of the ways in which you can work the look of your U-shaped kitchen. After all there is nothing like customizing your kitchen to your personal likes.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak:</strong> <em>A study table with drawers and cabinets will not only keep your children\u2019s bedroom organized but will also be useful in cultivating good study habits.</em></p><p>Of all the things in the world, getting your child to study is one of the toughest things to do. If you were to document every mother\u2019s concern about her child\u2019s study habits, you would have a book thicker than an Encyclopaedia. The real challenge is in getting children to focus and that can be done only when you remove distractions from their surroundings.</p><p>Here are a few ways in which a study table can help:</p><p><strong>Center of Attention:</strong> In a full house, there are too many things competing for your child\u2019s attention. If you have your child sit at the dining table with his books and the TV is in his line of sight, you can\u2019t blame him. Even the sanest adult cannot resist the temptation of watching his favorite serial on TV, and we are talking about a child with a weak will here. The best thing to do would be to eliminate all distractions and give him a quiet corner to study. Instead of having him study at the dining table, get him a study table of his own. A dedicated place of study is the first step towards cultivating healthy study habits.</p><p><strong>One stop solution:</strong> Children can come up with most interesting excuses to avoid doing things. Remember your own childhood? \u2013 when you\u2019d pretend to have a stomach ache just to avoid going to school? These days, you find children getting up from their seat of study multiple times on the pretext of getting an eraser, finding a book or sharpening their pencils. These are all perfectly valid excuses; you can\u2019t possibly ask them to go on studying without any of those things. What do you do then? Outsmart your kids! Get a study table with drawers and shelves. Store their stationery in the drawers and keep their books in the cabinets. Next time they make that excuse, just ask them to pull open the drawer.</p><p><em><strong>Posture Correction:</strong> Children complain of having back aches and neck aches while studying. While you maybe tempted to think that it is just another of their excuses, it actually isn\u2019t. This is often the result of a bad posture and a cause for concern. Sitting on the bed or on the sofa to do homework can cause mild to severe discomfort and this can impede your child\u2019s studying. Having a study table in his room can help him to correct his posture and concentrate on his study. You should also consider getting an ergonomically designed chair for the study table to prevent any damage to their shoulders or spine.</em></p>",

A little evaluation of your space is all that is required. </p><p>The great thing about a modular kitchen is that it fits in all that you need in a compact manner, in an aesthetic setting of your choice. There are several modular kitchen options that you may choose from, each of which offers you a range of fixtures, accessories and finishes. If you are planning to have a modular kitchen installed, here is some advice that will help you make a smart choice of kitchens.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/SWAN.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><b>The Design:</b> In the creation of any modular kitchen, the work triangle is the most important consideration. This is the placement of your fridge, cooking range and your cleaning area in such a way that each one is easily accessible. No matter what combination of distance you place them at, the total of all the distances must not exceed 26ft, if you are looking at making the space useful. Now, with these parameters in mind, you may opt to have the straight wall kitchen, the L or the U-shaped kitchen. Both of these kitchen also offer the flexibility of different lengths on each leg.</p><p><b>Space for Appliances:</b> If yours is a gadget-heavy kitchen, then you will need a modular kitchen that accommodates all that you have. Larger appliances like ovens, microwaves and wet grinders may be built into cabinets over each other. Small appliances such as coffee makers, hand blenders etc, may be placed on pull-out shelves or in modular cabinets. Your choice of kitchen will determine how much space you have for appliances.</p><p><b>Storage:</b> There can never be too much of storage space in a kitchen. Just about every inch will be used. If you prefer a minimalistic kitchen, then a straight wall one with proportionately adequate storage space is ideal. If however, you prefer large amounts of space, you may opt for a U-shaped kitchen, with an additional wall-mounted storage unit placed outside of the U. This gives you the flexibility of displaying your kitchen the way you like it. </p><p><b>The Finer Details:</b> It is important that your <b>modular kitchen</b> has adequate ventilation. Ensure that a chimney is a part of the package. If required, make provision for the addition of another window. All of this will reduce the grime in the kitchen and keep it a nice and airy place. </p><p>If you are working with minimal space, you will also need to ensure that there are no dead zones. Raising cabinets to the ceiling, and putting in open shelves will help in this aspect. </p><p><strong>Choosing the right <b>modular kitchen</b> is about understanding your space and your expectations from it. Work with your interior designer to come up with a great kitchen.</strong></p>",

With this done, the rest of your kitchen will fall in place. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p>While you may have chosen the perfect <b>modular kitchen</b> for you, narrowing down on the right finishes can be quite a task. The immense range to choose from, not to mention the fact that there is no such thing as a wrong choice, can make the decision all the more difficult to arrive at. Every kitchen is different, but there are a few basic points you may keep in mind when looking at finishes and <b>kitchen fittings</b>. </p><strong><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/SWAN.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong><p><b>Counter-tops:</b> Your counter-top is where most of the work for the day happens. It is also the most expansive part of your kitchen. You could begin making your choice from this large unit. Ideally stick to a single counter-top material. You may go in for solid granite or a range of composite materials. This will ensure that there are no deep lines on the stone and cleaning becomes an easy task. The only variation you could consider bringing in, is for the island or your pantry space. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p><b>Cabinets:</b> Your cabinets are where you should train your sights next. If you have a significantly large cabinet set up, you may want to begin with it, in terms of a finish choice. Keep your choice of materials minimalistic and simple. Ideal choice would be of marble and wood, with many people opting for slate as well. Limit your color palette to a maximum of two materials. Choose light-colored cabinetry and use small doses of another material to fill in space and add to its depth. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p><b>Contrast Finishes:</b> The key to making a visually appealing kitchen is to work with contrasts. If you have a dark counter-top, opt for light wall finishes around it. Alternate between a visually bright space and something more calm. </p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong><p>Once you have chosen materials for the largest components of your kitchen, you can then work on the floors as well as the accessories such as curtains, if any, and open shelving color. All of these various finishes will come together to form a seamless look for the <b>interior of your kitchen. </b></p><p><strong><br>It would be great if you allow an interior designer or a kitchen architect to work with you in creating the perfect space for you to cook for friends and family.</strong></p>",

If you are planning one for your home, here are some tips that will help you arrive at the perfect design.</p><p><strong>Evaluate your Space: </strong>Galley kitchens work ideally in small and medium spaces. What is important to remember is that the working spaces are not placed too far from each other. This brings down the efficiency of your kitchen. If you have a large space, then you may want to consider adding in a dining table to make the space more sociable, and both ends of the kitchen better accessible. Keep in mind that <strong>parallel kitchen layouts</strong> are usually more attuned to efficiency that being a social space.</p><p><strong>Symmetrical or Asymmetrical: </strong>You may choose to have a symmetrical kitchen where each side of the kitchen mirrors the other in terms of space placements. The alternate is an asymmetrical space in which you have multiple options. You may choose to have one wall with tall wall mounted cabinets or have all your appliances placed on one side. You may also choose to mix and match placements based on how you work in a kitchen.</p><p><strong>Working with a Corridor: </strong>In some cases you may have a parallel kitchen that is open on both ends or on a single one. In both cases the chances of the number of people moving about the kitchen increase. Especially if you have small children and pets in the house. To reduce the chances of any untoward incidents you may want to have your sink, and cook top on the same leg so that you don\u2019t suddenly turn around with a hot pot or a knife in your hand.</p><p>If your kitchen is blocked off only one side then you may want to make the most of the natural light that comes in. Make sure that your designer works on enhancing all the natural light in your kitchen. If space permits you may also include a small peninsula on one end where you can bring in a stool and sit down to write grocery lists or make recipes, or simply oversee your little one\u2019s homework.</p><p>These are some ways in which you can work out the layout of <strong>parallel kitchens</strong> to your advantage.

Here are some pointers that may help you with the decision-making. </p><p><b>The Benefits of Open Shelves</b></p><ul><li ><p>Open shelves gives you the benefit of a casual feel for your kitchen. It allows you and guests to lean over and pick the dish or cup of their choice. </p></li><li ><p>Such shelves also give you a range of material options to work with \u2013 from reclaimed wood, to the metal and more, thus giving you more looks to choose from.</p></li><li ><p>Open shelves are flexible in nature, which means you may adjust them to suit your current storage needs and <b>kitchen fittings</b> placements.</p></li><li ><p>These shelves are the ideal solution if you have a kitchen that has a number of awkward protrusions or pillars. It helps make good use of every space. </p></li></ul><p>What may be considered a drawback is that these shelves have to always be at their pristine best to look good. You will need to dust more and ensure that every vessel or crockery piece put up is squeaky clean. Else, it spoils the look of the shelves. </p><p><b>Are Closed Shelves Worth It?</b></p><ul><li ><p>Closed cabinets and shelves offer you a great deal of variety in terms of materials and finishes. You may use a range of woods, opt for eco-friendly materials, go with metal and so much more. In fact, each one of the materials you use may represent a particular theme and can be the basis of the d\u00e9cor of your kitchen. </p></li><li ><p>Cabinets help conceal all that you do not want to put on display. This means that clunky appliances and the several boxes of spices can all have a space of their own. </p></li><li ><p>Each storage space in a cabinet structure can be customized giving you the flexibility of creating your own unique storage units. </p></li></ul><p><strong>Perhaps the only drawback one could attribute to <b>kitchen cabinet designs</b> is the relatively high cost of customizing your kitchen. Though it is an investment for a lifetime, it is something that you will need to take into consideration. Working with an established kitchen d\u00e9cor specialist will help you make the right decisions.</strong></p>",

Let us give you a hand there. </p><p>It\u2019s true that the bed is the most important piece of furniture in the room. The room got named after it to prove that. But trust us when we say that the room is just not complete without at least one bedside table. </p><p>This small wondrous piece of furniture serves a very essential purpose.

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak:</strong> De-cluttering your <strong>kitchen cabinets</strong> and cupboards gives you more space for the important things you need on a regular basis.</p><p>As with cupboards anywhere in the house, kitchen drawers and cabinets tend to get cluttered and messy. Many times we remain comfortable with the thought of knowing what lies under what in a crowded drawer. But there will be days when you will roll up your sleeves and get down to de-cluttering your <strong>sleek kitchen</strong> and making it a much more accessible space.</p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/ORIOLE-Straight-Kitchen.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>So how does one go about de-cluttering kitchen storage space? For starters, you need to get down to the task at hand with a change in attitude. Most of us tend to be packrats, storing everything we get, from takeaway packaging to fancy looking plastic bottles and the like. You need to make up your mind to evaluate every item that you have and decide whether it is truly of use or not. This is the best way to get rid of all that you do not need.</p><p>To prepare for de-cluttering, you need to first clear up a working area where you can dump everything out of a drawer or cabinet. Also keep handy a few trash bags. You can use these to discard things, or segregate things to stow away later. Also keep a few boxes handy. These can be used to box up all that you do not use on a regular basis or to collect things that you want to give away.</p><p>Start from the cabinets on top and work your way down. For each item that you pick, as yourself a few questions to evaluate its necessity</p><ul><li><p>Is it in good condition?</p></li><li><p>Do I use it often?</p></li><li><p>Do I have too many of the same thing?</p></li><li><p>Can this be stored outside of the kitchen?</p></li><li><p>Can I place this in a particular category of items to store away?</p></li></ul><p>These questions will help you decide whether to keep an item or discard it or perhaps give it away. Once you are done sorting a cabinet or a shelf, clean the space out thoroughly, replace old newspapers that you may put down and then begin to keep things back. At this point, if you can place things in order of importance and utility, you will have a more functional kitchen.</p><p>Keep in mind that cleaning out kitchen cabinets and drawers can be a long and dreary task. Don\u2019t aim to finish all in one day. Space out your cleaning and this will help you see things more clearly when evaluating them.</p><p>Once your <strong>modular kitchen</strong> is sorted, make sure that you do your best not to start accumulating things again. Stick to the categories you have make and ensure that each item goes back to its designated place.</p>",

A good kitchen is one that is not cluttered, which has everything within arm\u2019s reach and is a pleasant place to spend some time in. Here are some general tips to help you maintain your kitchen.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/Blog___2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Stay Organized:</strong> It is important that you stay organized in the kitchen. Allow each category of kitchen items to have a place of their own. Ensure that everything you use goes back to its designated space at the end of the day. Instill this habit in all those who use the kitchen. That way, the responsibility for staying organized is shared by all.</p><p><strong>Cover Up:</strong> There are a few spaces that would do best to cover up. Your gas hob is one such place. You can line the burners with silver foil. This does not take away from the beauty of the gas hob, but acts as a perfect foil for all those drippings and stains that are a part of the cooking process. When you have guests visiting or are cleaning, you can simply remove the silver foil and replace it when you like. You can also consider putting up cling wrap on the wall directly behind the gas hob. Any kitchen grime that collects on this can be peeled away, without taking away from the beauty of your kitchen tiles.</p><p><strong>Deep Clean:</strong> Make it a point to clean down your kitchen thoroughly before you turn in for the day. This includes wiping down counters, the gas stove and the prep space. Sweep the floors after each session of cooking and discard all the dirt accumulated. Any stains on any surface must be dealt with immediately.</p><p>At least once a month, deep clean your <strong>kitchen cabinets</strong>. Pull out drawers, change newspapers placed on the base, and check for any bugs that may have taken up space in your kitchen.</p><p><strong>Regularly Purge:</strong> Invariably over time, you are bound to accumulate things in your kitchen. At least once a month, take it on yourself to purge the kitchen of all that you do not need. This will reduce clutter and help make it easier to maintain your kitchen.</p><p>These are just some of the simple ways that you can work into your <strong>modular kitchen</strong> handling routine so that maintaining it becomes easier with time.</p>",

The hygiene of your platform essentially dictates the quality of food that comes out of your kitchen. Here are a few ways that you can go about maintaining your platform.</p><p><strong>Prevent Stagnation:</strong> It is a given that you will be wiping down your kitchen platform each day. While doing this make sure that you do not have any small puddles of water stagnating around your platform. This can come from leaky bottles, a dented vessel or even a damp cloth that has been thrown on the platform.</p><p><strong>Wipe Before Use:</strong> Make sure to use a mild sanitizer to wipe down your platform before you use it to cut vegetables. This will get rid of any germs that may be on the surface of your platform.</p><p><strong>Let Your Platform Smell Good:</strong> There are quite a few simple home remedies that you can create to make your platform smell great. Squeeze in a few drops of lemon juice in warm water and wipe down your platform with it. This not only sanitizes, but also leaves a pleasant fragrance. You can try the same with some rose water as well. Keeping your platform free from roaches and insects is best done with citronella oil. This is a natural oil with a lemon base and a grassy finish. Wiping down your platform with this will keep it bug-free.</p><p><strong>Stain Removal:</strong> Many times, your platform is at the receiving end of spills and more. Dip a cloth in a small bit of vinegar and go over these stains. They will be removed in an instant thanks to acidic nature of the vinegar. Hot water and liquid detergents are your best options when it comes to regularly cleaning platforms.</p><p><strong>Modular kitchen designs</strong> are created in such a way so that there is ample working space on platforms.

Stand back, survey your kitchen and see how you can make it work for you. </p><p>If there is one thing that can be said about any kitchen is that there can never be enough of storage space. That being said, the modular kitchen perhaps offers you the best of storage space in an aesthetic setting. But if you are looking for just a little bit more, here are some spaces in your <b>kitchen\u2019s interior design</b> that you possibly didn\u2019t think of. What\u2019s more, here are some ideas to help you make the most of them. </p><p><b>Above Cabinets: </b>If you look closely at the shelves in your <b>modern kitchen </b>you will find that there is a lot of space above the cabinets that can be utilized smartly. This is a space you can choose to display your large crockery that is used only on occasion. You can further enhance the space by adding in little storage baskets made of wood or metal. Into this, can go extras from your pantry, surplus crockery and any other food items that you plan to store for the long term. </p><p><b>Inside Doors of Cabinets: </b>The inside of cabinet doors are quite versatile. For those that are placed above your working space, you can choose to include a file organizer on the door to put in a frequently used recipe book or to store sauce bottles. For the cabinets below, these same organizers can be used to store chopping boards. You may also consider installing a towel rod on the inside of cabinets. This can be used to hold your large vessel lids, where the knobs of the lids rest on the rods, holding them in place. </p><p><b>Below the Cabinets:</b> Every <b>modular kitchen</b> has neat bottom line to its overhead cabinets. This gives you some good space to work with. You can consider adding in tension rod racks to store spoons, knives, small crockery and your cooking basics. You can also fit in an enclosed book case for recipe books that you use regularly. A magnetic board fitted onto the wall between the work platform and the overhead cabinets will eliminate the need for a knife stand. Similarly tension rods with hooks suspended below the cabinets will give you space to hang up your tea cups. </p><p><b>Under the Sink: </b>This is perhaps the most under-rated space you have in a modular kitchen. The side walls can have roll dispensers fit in. This way your garbage bags will always be close on hand. To make most of the floor space, fit the inside of these doors with racks to store all your cleaning implements for the kitchen. This way you can keep the floor below the sink free from clutter. </p><p><strong>These are just some of the ways to work around your kitchen interiors and make the most of them. </strong></p>",

    "blog_content": "<b>Expert Speak: </b>Going green in your kitchen is simply a matter of a few lifestyle changes. Consider recycling, batch cooking and investing in 5-star rated appliances.</p><p>Each one of us wants to do our part in ensuring that we go green. One of the best places to start with in our homes is the <b>modular kitchen</b>. Here is a space that offers you ample opportunity to go green, without compromising on aesthetics or the utility of your kitchen. Here are some ways in which you can go green with your kitchen interiors:</p><p><b>Storage: </b>To enhance the look of your <b>kitchen interiors</b>, you tend to invest in a lot of plastic designer containers for storage. These are the least eco-friendly way of going about things. What you can do instead is opt for glass. They are aesthetic and long-lasting. In terms of hygiene too, they can be cleaned easily and the chances of mold and fungal growth are minimal. Of course, they have to be handled with care, else they can break. </p><p>Recycle, coffee, jam, ghee, dish washing detergent jars. Always buy refill packs for each of these products. Use large air-tight storage containers when you bulk buy grains, but ensure that you place what you need for a week\u2019s usage in glass containers on your shelves. </p><p>You may even choose to replace all your plastic water bottles with glass bottles \u2013 screw cap wine bottles make an excellent option. Of course, retain a few plastic ones if you have children in the house. </p><p><b>Appliances: </b>When you invest in <b>kitchen gadgets</b>, ask yourself whether you really need that espresso coffee machine or that juicer. While these may seem like great investments, such products often take up a lot of space and electricity. When you invest in appliances, ensure that you buy something that has a 5 star rating for power consumption. This way your power usage reduces and you kitchen is green. </p><p><b>Cleaning Solutions: </b>A lot of chemicals are often used in the cleaning of your kitchen. Opt instead for eco-friendly cleaning options. Vinegar, baking soda and salt can be potent cleaning bases for sinks, clogged drains, appliance interiors and working surfaces. Replace all the chemicals in your kitchen with these for a more eco-friendly space. </p><p><strong>These are just some of the ways in which your kitchen can be converted into a green space. In fact, you can even do so with your cooking. Plan a menu in advance and bulk cook. This reduces gas consumption in the long term. Freeze portions of food for use across time. This way you reduce the time you spend in the kitchen, while having a great meal on the table for your family.</strong></p>",

Instinct is to arrange things in terms of size and shape. Another would be to place things in order of importance and how often you use them. While these are workable in themselves, they may not always be the ideal storage solutions to opt for. Here are some ways in which to plan organizing your <b>kitchen cabinets</b>. </p><p>These tips work whether you are organizing your new <b>sleek kitchen</b> for the first time or are organizing your space after a period of use. </p><p><b>Start Empty:</b> Make sure that all your cabinets are empty to begin with. Dust them, disinfect them if needed and put down layers of paper to keep the base clean. As you empty out cabinets, it would be a good idea to start segregating things \u2013 throw away containers that you don\u2019t need or which don\u2019t have lids. Keep multiples of certain products together. Check for expiry dates and make sure that you throw away anything that is past its prime. </p><p><b>Group your Products:</b> In order to get an organized storage space, it is important that you group together all your kitchen items. Some categories can be \u2013 baking supplies, spices, ready-mixes and pastes, staples, dry products, and the like. The same idea can be applied to the contents of your refrigerator as well. </p><p><b>Stacking your Shelves:</b> There are a few pointers you need to keep in mind when storing away your things. This checklist will help</p><ul><li >Stack pots and pans as well as cooking cutlery close to the stove top \u2013 in drawers and cabinets below. </li><li >Keep spice bottles, preferably on a rotatable Lazy Susan rack or in a compact shelf close on hand.</li><li >Store all dry staples in overhead cabinets either to the left or right of the cooking station.</li><li >Place snacks and other ready-to-eat products in a lower bin or cabinet so that the family has easy access to it. </li><li >When it comes to your fridge, place products in order of their expiry date. This way you are sure to use things within the time stipulated. This reduces wastage as well. </li><li >Invest in sets of clear containers in uniform sizes. These may be placed inside your shelves or in cabinets to store a range of products instead of packets with rubber bands around them. The clear containers will make it easy to pick what you need. The uniform size ensures they are stackable over or next to each other, without wasting space. </li></ul><strong>The <b>interior design of a kitchen</b> will be all the more enhanced when it is stacked and arranged in a systematic manner. It may take you a while to get the hang of organizing a kitchen, but once done, you will thoroughly enjoy maintaining and using your space. </strong>",

    "blog_content": "<b>Expert Speak:</b> Cleaning your kitchen with home-made cleaning solutions ensures a sparkling clean space, at a fraction of the usual cost. It also ensures that your family is not in contact with harmful chemicals. </p><p>You have got yourself the <b>modular kitchen</b> that you have been dreaming of. You are now keen on doing your best to keep it clean not only on the surface level, but on a micro level as well. Of course the market is flooded with a range of chemical-based products that you may use to clean your kitchen. However, this is a space that you utilize to cook for your family. The slightest cross-contamination from these chemicals can have disastrous results on the health of your family. </p><p>Here are some eco-friendly cleaning solutions that you can easily make at home and use in your kitchen. Not only are they effective, but they have absolutely no negative effects on the health of your family. </p><p><b>Kitchen Sinks: </b>The sink is often a dumping ground for leftover food, spills, and even when you clean the platform and squeeze out the cloth. The chances of bacterial growth here are high, as is the presence of mold and germs. An effective cleaner may be made out of lemon juice or diluted vinegar (1:2). Soak your sink in this mixture for half an hour and then rinse clean. The acidity levels of the juice or the vinegar effectively kill all bacteria and germs. If you have a steel sink, you can scrub it down with some baking soda and salt and then rinse off. </p><p><b>Unclogging Drains:</b> Boil 4 liters of water along with half a cup of salt. Most clogs clear out with this mix. If you find that you are dealing with something stubborn, first pour down half a cup of baking soda and follow that up with half a cup of vinegar. You will find the rim of your drain fizzing for a while. Once this stops, wash down the solution with boiling water. This process is ideal for metal plumbing systems. </p><p><b>Cleaning Appliances:</b> You can use a damp sponge dipped in baking soda to scour the inside of your oven, microwave and your stove top to get them to sparkle clean. For really stubborn stains, make a paste of baking soda with water and apply it thoroughly to the inside of your oven or microwave. Let it be for 3 hours before you wipe it down with a wet cloth. </p><p><b>Cleaning Kitchen Cabinets:</b> All the shelves and surfaces of your <b>kitchen cabinets</b> may easily be cleaned with a mixture of vinegar and warm water (1:3). This will kill any bacteria and will ensure that oily grime, if any, is thoroughly removed. You may even add in a drop or two of essential oils for that sweet, lingering smell. </p><p><strong>Each of these home-made solutions will take a little extra effort in preparation and usage, but the end-result is a sparkling clean <b>kitchen interiors</b>, at the fraction of a cost. More importantly, it is the healthiest option for your family.</strong></p>",

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak:</strong> Creating a small garden to a modular kitchen is a simple task. It gives your <strong>modular kitchen</strong> an added layer of utility and beauty.</p><p>There is no better feeling that reaching out to a pot of fresh coriander leaves, plucking a few and putting the final touches to your homely dal.

But there are several interesting ways in which this issue can be addressed. Besides pots of every conceivable shape, you may also consider wall-mounted racks to hold your pots. Empty food containers make the perfect pots as well.</p><p>If you do not have ample sunlight then opt for black pots. These absorb heat rather quickly and retain them for a longer time, giving your plants a good chance at survival. You can create a grid for pot-holders that may be hung on your window rods. In fact, you will find a number of gardening specialists that will customize an indoor garden set up for you. A sure-fire, economic way of doing things is to rest your pots on a shoe rack that has been positioned well.</p><p><strong>Choosing Your Plants:</strong> Over-enthusiasm can get the better of you at times. Many tend to go overboard and start with as many plants as they can. This can end up with disastrous results \u2013 you may not be able to care for the plants well. Also, you may end up with more produce than you can handle.

If the soil is dry, water your plant. Another method is to lightly lift your pot. If it feels light, then the plant needs watering. Keep in mind that in summers, your plants may need additional watering. This need will come down during the rains and in the winters.</p><p><strong>Creating Simple Compost for you Plants:</strong> This is a simple exercise that you may do for each of your plants. At the end of each day, have a small bin where you collect food-based waste from your modular kitchen. This can include coffee and tea grounds, fruit and vegetable peels, egg shells and the like. Do not include any cooked food. Use this mix at the base of the pot, over this goes the soil. This creates a perfect manure base for your plants.

    "blog_content": "<strong>Expert Speak:</strong> A good ventilation system will ensure that you have a great space to cook and spend time in. It also ensure the longevity and efficiency of all of your appliances.</p><p>Designing a <strong>modular kitchen</strong> is no easy task. You have a defined space to work with, often not as much as you want. You also have to worry about dry and wet areas, plumbing and electrical lines, not to mention storage and safety as well. All of these requirements have to fit into aesthetic setting.</p><p>One of the important elements that contributes to the beauty and practical value of your modular kitchen is the ventilation that is provided in your kitchen. The ventilation of a kitchen determines the quality of air as well as the energy efficiency of a space. There are several ways in which your designer will work in creating a well-ventilated kitchen for you.</p><p><strong>Using the Exterior Wall:</strong> Your cooking range is central to the kitchen design. It has to be placed against an exterior wall. The range is the main source of fumes as well as grease during the cooking process. Combined with other elements, fumes and grease can also give rise to several other contaminants. Placing your cooktop against an exterior wall makes it easy to create a ventilation system that takes fumes out of the house. You may use venting ducts that lead out through the wall or ceiling. If you would like to conceal them, then headers should do the job. The closer the stove is to the exterior wall, the lesser duct work you have to deal with. An important aspect you have to keep in mind though, is how your home looks on the exterior should a venting hole be cut through.</p><p><strong>Selecting the Ideal Hood and Fan: </strong>A ventilation hood is the best way to effectively ventilate your kitchen. For the job to be done well, you must choose the right kind of hood for your range. Ideally the hood should cover the space above the stove and for a drop down of at least 3 inches on all sides. The exhaust fan you choose must be ideal for the size of modular kitchen you have. This is usually based on a per cubic foot system.</p><p><strong>Ventilating Your Island Cooktop:</strong> Some modular kitchens have the cooking range incorporated into the island. In such cases, the usual systems of ventilation will not work well. Such stoves will need a downdraft system. This does not require an overhead hood or duct work. The fumes are sucked in to a low pressure system that is placed at the burner level. This takes away all smells, moisture as well as fumes down below and then out of the house. This may not be as effective as the overhead hood, but it does its job well.</p><p><strong>Incorporate Windows:</strong> There is nothing like having a good set of windows to bring in sunshine and fresh air into your kitchen. You can enhance your ventilation system by bringing in some more windows and opening them up. This allows for natural air circulation, removing all smells and moistness from a kitchen quickly. While one good window will do the job, you may consider a second one if it does not compromise on wall storage space for you.</p><p>If you already have your designer kitchen set-up, then there are few other things that you can consider. For starters, push all your appliances to the wall and remove any air gaps that may be there. This ensures that all warm area drifts above and away from the appliance in a particular direction. This will be eliminated from your kitchen through your exhaust system.</p><p>Maintaining your modular kitchen\u2019s ventilation systems is as important as the task of airing out your kitchen. Such cleaning will ensure that there is no grime building up and no dirt clogging up systems. Warm air that passes through your exhaust brings with it moisture and fine pieces of dust. Constant accumulation of these will bring down the efficiency of your exhaust system. Make sure that you have a professional cleaning service come in and regularly service all the ventilation systems in your kitchen.</p><p>The lack of a good ventilation system in your <strong>modular kitchen design</strong> can result in overheating as well. This will make your kitchen an unpleasant place to be in. It can also affect your appliances and their efficiency in the long run. Ensuring that you have a professionally designed ventilation system in place and that it is well maintained will give you a kitchen that is a pleasure to be in each and every day.</p>",

Keeping them spotlessly clean will give your designer kitchen an overall clean and bright look.</p><p>Your <strong>designer kitchen</strong> often holds a pride of place in your heart. It is a place where you cook for your family and have them gather around for a meal. It is place you head to when you want to relax or show your family you care. It is also a great place to socialize, whether with friends or family. Nothing beats the homeliness of a kitchen.</p><p>Now while your designer kitchen may be the one place that everyone likes heading to, it is also a space that needs to be kept pristinely clean. Nobody likes to come into a kitchen that has stains of grime, stale food and dust.</p><p>Most designer kitchens tend to have a light color scheme going. Therefore, it becomes all the more important that you take the trouble to keep you kitchen clean. Light colors tend to show stains, even from a long distance away. White designer kitchens, though a pleasure to have and look at, can also fall easily to the menace of stains. Here are a few ways in which you can work on keeping your countertops and kitchen tiles clean.</p><p><strong>Cleaning Tiles</strong></p><p>One of the main issues with designer kitchen tiles is the grout. While black grout does not really show stains, white and grey definitely do. Stains build-up from the number of footfalls you have in your kitchens, or the spills, dust and accidental stains that happen.</p><p>Cleaning tiles does not have to be a cumbersome process. All you have to do is understand the best method to tackle these stains and work on them. When it comes to cleaning grout, it is not the cleaner, but rather the method you use that makes all the difference. Here are some fail-proof steps for effective grout cleaning.</p><ol><li><p>Sweep or dry mop your tiles on the floor and on the wall before you begin cleaning the grout. This is a simple way of removing dust that has accumulated. It also gives you an idea on where some of the stubborn stains are present.</p></li><li><p>Based on the tiles you have and the cleaning solution requirements of the particular brand, apply the cleaner on the grout and ensure that it is completely covered. The solution may get absorbed in, so use discretion and use enough to cover the edges but not soak the tiles.</p></li><li><p>Let the cleaner rest for around half hour. This gives the stains time to soak and come loose.</p></li><li><p>Take a hard bristled brush and go over the grout and stains thoroughly. Alternately you could even use an old toothbrush for the crevices.</p></li><li><p>Mop the floor with clean water and dry the floor. Your job is now done.</p></li></ol><p>Besides the grout, you have the tile as well that needs cleaning. The market is flooded with cleaning solutions for the same. If you would rather make an organic solution of your own, you could make a paste of baking soda and water and apply this to the tiles. Do not however, use bleach or baking soda on marble tiles. For those, mild, dish washing soap is the best. A good scrub with a cloth with this solution is going to be enough to get your tiles sparkling.</p><p>Once you are done cleaning, it is good idea to come up with the means of maintaining your kitchen floors on a regular basis. Sweep and mop your designer kitchen on a regular basis as well as attend to any stains immediately. This will ensure that you do not have too much of a build-up when you get down to deep cleaning.</p><p><strong>Cleaning Kitchen Countertops</strong></p><p>One of the joys of a <strong>modular kitchen</strong> are the beautiful countertops that you have. Whether it is your prepping area or the space on the island, these countertops may of various materials. Here is how you can keep these clean with minimal effort.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Granite countertops</strong>: These can be cleaned down with a mild soap solution.

Every one of us has a favorite color that we would like to see on the walls of our home. Here are some tips to choose a color palette and how to use it across your home.</p><p>Now, we all have a favorite color that we would like to see splashed all over our homes. But fact remains, you can\u2019t use a single shade everywhere. What you will need is a paint palette, or a few ways in which your favorite color can be utilized, in a smart way. This palette will include shades and hues of your color of choice as well as other shades that can be used in conjunction with it. Some great options would be:</p><ul><li><p>Light blue with hues of grey</p></li><li><p>A sunshine palette of gold, butter yellow and cream</p></li><li><p>Leaf green, olive green and a pastel shade like pink</p></li><li><p>Deeper colors of burgundy, putty grey and a berry shade work really well</p></li></ul><p>It would be best to work with your interior designer on a color palette that incorporates your favorite color without making it overwhelming. Once you have decided on a color scheme, there are multiple ways in which you can bring it into each of the room in your home. Here are ideas that may help.</p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/blog_dec22_6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Paint a Wall or a Room:</strong> If you have chosen a bold color like orange or red, you could consider painting an entire room with the shade. This could be your bedroom or the family room. Alternately, you could think of painting a single wall in your living room with this shade. Place a neutral colored <strong>shoe rack</strong> in front of it and you have a wonderful, lively spot in your home with your favorite color.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/philipp_front_view.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Accent your Home:</strong> One of the best ways to bring in a color of your choice is to use it as accents through your home. This gives your home a brilliant color splash in just the right places. For example you can use your favorite color on alternate book shelves, or the awnings over your windows or even for <strong>wardrobes</strong> in your bedroom. Such accents give you a beautiful pop of color in every room.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/1.Helma_Front_sandoak.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Go Traditional:</strong> If you would like to bring in a traditional touch to your rooms, you could use a favorite color as the background and work on creating a uniquely traditional design on it. Such a wall may be placed behind your cupboards or your crockery shelves. They make for a great way to accentuate the look of your room and home.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/blog_dec22_5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Create a Focus Point:</strong> Rather than work with paints, you may also consider working with accessories to bring in your favorite color. For example you could think of a large blue chandelier over your dining table. Or perhaps the massive cupboard in your bedroom could go with a shade of blue to stand out. Think of blue shelves, or window trimmings. The possibilities are endless. You may also consider using seating arrangements to bring in color of your choice.</p><p>Sometimes you may have more than one favored color and are unsure of what to go with. In such a situation, you may consider taking cues from your furniture and accessories. For example, your carpet or rugs. If you find that there is a predominant color in them that you like, you could work your color palette around it. In fact you can go a step further and add more depth to each of your color choices by working on textures. From fibrous textures of a carpet, to the smoothness of cushions, to the lightness of the curtains, there is a lot you can achieve.</p><p>You could choose to work with only fabric and incorporate your favorite color into cushions, bed covers, curtains, tablecloths. Another option is to bring your color to the fore with the art work that you display around your home.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/Ross_Front_Weinrot-_-Weiss.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Once you have the colors of your choice up around your home, you may also consider working on highlighting these colors. This may be done with the help of the right artwork or furniture accessories. Furniture that works well in terms of accentuating are cupboards, wardrobes, <strong>shoe racks</strong> and the like. Heavy items are ideal to offset bright patches of paint.</p><p>Work with your interior designer on choosing the right colors and working them into your d\u00e9cor. A professional will have be able to look at the broader picture in terms of visualizing where a color fits in. This will give your home a cohesive, yet gorgeous look.</p>",

These <strong>bed side tables</strong> have evolved over time to look aesthetic and be utilitarian on multiple levels. In fact, they are perhaps the most stylish of accessories you have in your bedroom today.</p><p>If you are in the market for a <strong>bed side table</strong>, it would be a good idea to know of the different kinds that you can choose from. There are primarily 3 kinds of such tables \u2013 each serving a slightly different purpose, but ultimately providing the same utility. Here are the three basic types:</p><p><strong>The Bedside Chest:</strong> This is a model that comes with 2-3 drawers and is ideal for those who need storage space for multiple things. While the top may be used for books, water and alarm clocks, the drawers may be used to stash TV remotes, chargers and even lens cleaning solution and moisturizers. Rather than have all these clutter your dressing table, the best place for them would be a chest of drawers beside the bed.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/1.Punto_front_caffe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>The Bedside Cabinet:</strong> These cabinets provide storage space, but of a slightly different kind. They come with a large cabinet and then a series of drawers over it. The benefit is your ability to store larger things like bed linen and extra pillows in the cabinet and your smaller essentials in the top drawers.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/1.Tuborg_front_Brownlarch.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>The Nightstand:</strong> This is one bedside table that lays emphasis on style quotient than it does on storage. This does not go to say that it cannot be a great option. The storage space on such designs is minimal, giving you just enough for your alarm clock, water, a book and perhaps your phone or reading glasses.</p><p>Now that you know of the different kinds of bedside tables available, it would a good idea to also understand the things you need to keep in mind when narrowing down on a choice. Of course, you will also have your interior designer working with you, helping you make the right choice. Here are some tips that will help:</p><p><strong>Your use of the table:</strong> How you plan to use the <strong>bedside table</strong> is of key importance when making a choice. If you are looking for a convenient space to place your alarm, clock and watch, then a nightstand will be ideal. This is only if you do not have anything bulkier to store.</p><p>But if you do have a number of items that form your night time ritual, then you must look at tables that offer you place to store as well as to display. Having multiple storage options is the best way to go. A bedside chest of drawers will be the ideal choice here.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/1.Belgian_front_cherry.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Style and design:</strong> Now once you are sure of the kind of <strong>side table</strong> you are looking for, your next step will be to look for something with great style and a design that fits into the d\u00e9cor theme of you bedroom. If you are investing in a bedroom furniture set, then the table will naturally be a part of the d\u00e9cor. However, if you are looking at creating an independent unit to add in, then you will have to evaluate your d\u00e9cor and make a choice accordingly. Assess whether the d\u00e9cor is traditional or contemporary. If you would like your tables to be the focal point of the room, then paying special attention to their color, size and styling is important.

With rooms becoming smaller with time, you need to understand how much space you have for the placement of tables and if you really need two or just the one.</p><p>It is important to assess this as it will give you an idea of whether you want a wall mounted unit or one that stands on its own legs. You will also need to look at the depth and width that you have for the table. It has to be just the right size so you don\u2019t end up banging elbows or knees when getting in and out of bed.</p><p>Irrespective of the amount of space you have, there is no dearth of designs and possibilities with <strong>side tables</strong>. All you have to do is work with your interior designer to create a set that is best suited to your bedroom and the space allotted.</p>",

Here are some ideas to help you get more space to work with in your bedroom.</p><p>Most bedrooms have immense potential in terms of space creation. In most cases you have it all lying around you, waiting to be spotted and utilized. Here are some ideas for you to work with:</p><p><strong>Maximize the Space under Your Bed:</strong> Most master bedrooms have a king size bed. The space beneath the bed is often left empty. Alternately, it ends up being a space you dump all that you do not want to see on a regular basis. You can get custom-made under-bed containers created. These can hold a range of things \u2013 from woolens, linens as well as wires and small accessories to gadgets that you use. They can also hold bags You can even segregate what goes into your cupboard on a seasonal basis and stash what you don\u2019t need currently under the bed.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/2.Trasher_wardrobe_int_low.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Make the Most of Your Wardrobe:</strong> We tend to fill up our bedrooms with storage units that we deem are essential.

Anything that you may not be able to fit into these, may be placed in alternate storage units that may be finalized on a bit later.</p><p>Bedroom wardrobe and closets need to have ample shelf and hanger space. Adding in shelves into a cupboard is easy enough, but space for hangers is always limited. Work with your designer to create a cupboard that caters to your specific storage needs. Estimate how much of rod space you will need and how many shelves. Have a broad idea of how much you would like to store and in what way. If you have a lot of items that need to go on hangers, it\u2019s best to have two sets of rods \u2013 one from the top and one, an equal distance from the bottom. This gives you double the space to work with.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/1.MICHAEL_front.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Go upwards:</strong> In a designer bedroom, you will find space above your <strong>wardrobe</strong>, especially if they are not the in-built models. Create storage bins that may be placed on the top of these <strong>wardrobe</strong>s for things you do not need on a regular basis. Often travel bags, totes, excess handbags and the like can all find a place here.</p><p>If you do have inbuilt <strong>wardrobe</strong>, you may want to consider including overhead shelving to create more space that is not in the way. These may be used in several ways, as you see fit. These shelves can extended horizontally on the wall rather than into the room. This ensures that there is no intrusion into the space that you use.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/hannes-front_view.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Give Your Child More Space:</strong> Getting more space in your child\u2019s room is imperative. Some of these tips may easily be used to get more bedroom storage space in your kid\u2019s room. Make the bed stashable and install, closed shelves on the underside of the bed. During the day, the bed may be raised into place and children may pull out their toys and play comfortably in their rooms. Alternately, pull out drawers at the base of the bed are a great place to stash toys and even books. Install a series of pull out bins on the wall for children to easily pick up after themselves and put away things. Bins are easier to work with than shelves and hangers, when it comes to children.</p><p>There are a few other simple tricks to get more space in your bedroom. You could consider wall mounting your entertainment unit so that the floor and the wall space below it are free. You could also have shelves and closed drawers built into your bed\u2019s headboard, on either side to make space.</p><p>There are several ways in which you can work towards getting more bedroom storage.

And that is when you will spot a dark corner, something that you may not have noticed before. </p><p><strong>There are many times, when working on the interiors of our homes, we tend to design for the most obvious spaces. When it is all done, you find that you have a full dull corners that could do with some lifting up \u2013 perhaps the space under the staircase, or a dull foyer, or an empty corner. Here are some ideas for those living room spots that you tend to miss out. </strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><img  src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/2_91abeb98-edb1-4721-a99f-2adbd0c1c031.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></p><p><b>The Foyer:</b> Most Indian households have a foyer that leads into the living room. Essentially it acts as the gateway into the hall. These are spaces that tend to be dull, a dump-yard for footwear and umbrellas, among other things. This foyer must be your first spot to brighten up. </p><p>Too begin, empty the foyer space completely of all there is. Step outside your house and look at what can be seen in the frame of the foyer. The most prominent first spot is above the doorway leading to the foyer \u2013 place an ornate mirror, if you lean towards Feng Shui at this point. It reflects light, brings in brightness and makes your foyer the perfect portal into your living room. </p><p>Alternately you could consider curtaining the foyer, lending that small touch of mystery to what lies beyond it. </p><p><strong><strong>If you have the space, place in an ornate table with decorative bowls for your keys and other knick-knacks. A wall mounted aquarium makes for a mesmerizing element in your foyer and teaser of what\u2019s to come in the living room.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><img  src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/3_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong></p><p><b>The Living Room: </b>Your living room is your little haven to come home to at the end of every day. It is a place you relax, entertain guests, spend time with the family and more. There can be a few places in your living room to liven up as well. Let\u2019s start with the most obvious \u2013 the space under the staircase. This is a very versatile spot and can be done up in so many ways.</p><p><strong><strong><strong>How about bringing in a designer seawater aquarium that takes up all the space under the staircase. This can be a mesmerizing addition to your living room. There are several studies that emphasize the benefits of watching fish in their natural habitat.</strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong><img  src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/4_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong></strong></p><p>The space under the staircase can also be used to create lovely cubbyholes for your child to play, or to spend time reading in a small library. This can be designed to be at the height of the child, making it all the more enjoyable. </p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong>It can also be used to create a display for all the souvenirs you collect, a library for yourself, a cozy nook for your pet as well. There is just so much you can do.</strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><img  src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/5_a5159786-71b9-4a68-ac55-d3d11a434bb7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p><b>Odd shaped Corners:</b> Sometimes, in the creation of your home, there can be a few odd corners in your hall, where you can neither put a table nor a chair. For such spaces, you could take things to the floor level. Throw a rug on the floor, add in a couple of quirky cushions and a little artistic lamp at ground level and you have lovely, bright corner in your home. </p><p>Alternately you could consider adding in open shelves in a pattern that complements the shape of the corner wall. Add to this small artefacts and curios and you have a brilliant space to show off. </p><p>You may also find that you have good space lying absolutely dormant below your window. \u00a0Adding in a rug with a lantern, or a decorative magazine stand or simply an odd mix of stuffed toys can totally liven up the space. </p><p>You may also have a large space on your wall but have one too many paintings up already. If such is the case, here is what you can do. Drill into the wall, place in a curtain rod and hang up a pretty curtain. It cuts through the empty space in a great way, ensuring that your living room does not end up looking too cluttered. </p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>These are just some of the ways in which you can brighten up dull spots in your living room and in the areas surrounding it. Of course, you can let your imagination run wild, depending on the space you have the artistic leaning you have. Work with an interior designer to bring your ideas to life. </strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>",

This can be the child\u2019s room, a dedicated play area in the family room or even a little shelf with his toys and books in your own bedroom. As the child grows older, studies become an integral part of his childhood years. Inculcating a sense of responsibility towards studies is something that is best done early on. You can start with a dedicated study space that is equipped with a comfortable <strong>study table</strong>.</p><p>Having a personal space to study will help a child in several ways. Some of these are:</p><ul><li>A <strong>study table</strong> provides an organized space to study</li><li>It inculcates a sense of discipline in a child</li><li>It helps increase concentration since all other distractions are kept away</li><li>It helps instill responsibility in keeping the space neat and clean</li><li>The ergonomic design ensures that the child\u2019s posture is maintained all through the study period</li><li>It is a great addition to a child\u2019s room, adding to its aesthetic value</li><li>It also encourages a child in multiple ways \u2013 studies, activities and more</li><li>It gives a child a space to show off to friends and family, especially if he is getting a lot of interesting work done at the table</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/1.Bruno_front_brown_oak_creme.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>So while it is established that having a uniquely designed table to study is a good idea, it is important as parents to know how to make the right choice for your child. The market is flooded with several options, but it is necessary that you assess the needs of your child and pick one.</p><p>Many a times we tend to forget that children have to live in a world where everything is adult-sized. Booster seats and cushions, uncomfortable seating are often a way of life for younger ones. Having to make do with adult furniture for a long while can affect their posture to a large extent. But that doesn\u2019t always have to be so.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/Timm_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>It is not really feasible to have all furniture in your home designed to be kid-sized. But what you can do, is ensure that they have at least one piece that is uniquely theirs. This could be the table at which they study. A <strong>study table</strong> can make a world of difference to how your children approach their school work.</p><p>You may work with your designer to ensure that you have a customized table for your child. Such ergonomic designs will help your child study well in the long run. Here are some tips to help you choose the right table:</p><p><strong>Availability of Space:</strong> Before you actually get down to choosing a table, it is important that you assess the amount of space you have to fit it in. Its placement in a child\u2019s room is also equally important. Placing it against a natural source of light is ideal. It should also not be cramped along with other elements of a child\u2019s bedroom. Ensure that the design adheres to any unique configurations you have around the room.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/Simone_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Quality of Materials: </strong>No matter what design you choose for the <strong>study table</strong>, it is important that you select quality material. Wood is a common preference and one that lasts a long while. Laminates, plastic and metal are other options as well. No matter what your choice, you have to ensure that the quality is such that it remains a safe space for your child. Rusting metal, chipping wood and weak plastic can prove harmful in more ways than one. Choose your materials wisely.</p><p><strong>Appropriate Size</strong>: It is important that you choose the right size of <strong>study table</strong> and chair for your child to sit at and grow into as well. The area of the table should be large enough to hold 2-3 open books simultaneously and give a child enough of space to maneuver around. Too large or too small can be uncomfortable for a child. You may also consider designing an adjustable table that lasts a longer time, as your child grows.</p><p><strong>Choosing Age Appropriate Colors:</strong> Your children will love the idea of having brightly colored <strong>study tables</strong> to study at. You could choose from a range of your child\u2019s favorite shades. You could also introduce art work or decals of your child\u2019s favorite fictional characters. All of this will go a long way in making the table a special one for your child to sit at.</p><p><strong>A Range of Design Options:</strong> There are several varieties of <strong>study table</strong>s available today. You can choose to have tables and chairs that are fixed into a single unit. You could also opt for those that have bookshelves incorporated into them. Flexible elements in terms of table heights, removable shelves and other storage options can also be considered. Work with your child\u2019s unique requirements and the aesthetics that you want to achieve.</p><p><strong>Study table</strong>s for children are a great addition to their rooms. Besides being functional, they lend a sense of aesthetics to the space. There are a range of materials for you to choose from as well as designs. Working with a professional designer can make some of your online choices great pieces to own.</p>",

    "blog_content": "<b>Expert Speak: </b>Making your kitchen look expensive is quite simple and not taxing on your wallet, with these easy tips.</p><p>Besides, the living room, your kitchen is perhaps the most sought after room in the house. Not only is it a space where you cook for your family and keep them happy, it is now also a place to socialize. It is common to see children doing their homework in the kitchen while you prep, or perhaps enjoy a snack at the <b>island</b> while you cook. In fact, many homes are increasingly entertaining friends and family in the kitchen. </p><p>With so much happening in this space, it is natural that you will want your kitchen to look its best. If you can make it look expensive without actually pinching your wallet too hard, then that would be an additional bonus. Kitchens tend to get a little boring in terms of d\u00e9cor, simply because everything is symmetrical \u2013 you have even lines, equally shaped drawers and cabinets, and in general, things that are uniformly shaped. </p><p><strong>Of course, all this goes a long way in ensuring that your kitchen is organized and good looking, but you may want a little more. Here are a few tips that will help you bring in the luxe factor into your modular kitchen.</strong></p><p>\u00a0<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/Buzzard_white_red_Low.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong><b>Change Seating:</b> If your kitchen dining nook has wooden bar stools as a seating option, you will want to try an upgraded version. Rather than have wooden stools, bring in elevated cushioned seating in colors that match your walls. These cushioned seats instantly brighten the dining area and make for more comfortable dining experience. Alternately you could look at introducing smart chairs, with meshed backrests or bucket seats that support the back better.</strong></p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/3-compressor_efd85ed4-e377-40ee-9211-23c2e9bf863d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></p><p><strong><b>Let your Walls and Nooks Tell Stories: </b>Those empty walls and corners on your kitchen <b>counter</b> are best used to tell stories. Bring out heirloom crockery and display them on walls in an asymmetric manner. Rotate your collection to give your kitchen a new look each time. Brighten up a dull corner with a simple statue or an ornate looking vase. The breath of life such small things infuse is amazing. If you don\u2019t own things that can go up on these walls and corners, then consider browsing through at flea markets to get some good ones.</strong></p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/MANAKIN_L-Shaped_Kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></p><p><strong><b>Lighting Up: </b>How about bringing some life into your lighting fixtures in the kitchen. If you have an island dining area consider a small chandelier over it. This brings a touch of elegance to just about any space. Alternately you could think of bringing in light fixtures that have metallic finishes for the shades \u2013 gold and silver go really well in most kitchens. Light up a <b>cabinet</b> with small spotlights that highlight interesting finishes.</strong></p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/Brambling_Aurbergene_Low.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></p><p><strong><b>Change Kitchen Appliances: </b>If you have a few dated kitchen appliances, now would be the time to change them. The way to achieve an expensive look is to invest in appliances that have a stainless steel finish. This is a look that never gets old and one that can remain shining for a long while to come. If it is within your budget, also consider bringing in a cooking range hood. These are available in color shades to match most d\u00e9cor. Finding one for you will be easy.</strong></p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/LARK_Straight_Kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></p><p><b>Play with Colors: </b>Bring in a change to the color palette of your kitchen \u2013 opt to go matte all through. This could be done in greys, white and blacks, giving your kitchen a highly stylized look. If you would rather stick with a light color palette, then you could add in a brightly colored rug in your kitchen. Most people believe that mats and rugs are out of place in a kitchen. Place one in and see how it brightens up your space. If you have a dining nook, adding in bright cushions and floral arrangements will brighten up the corner immensely. </p><p><strong><strong><b>Look inside your Cabinets: </b>Kitchen cabinets that have glass doors will benefit greatly from having a brightly colored wallpaper placed in the background. This adds a pop of color and instantly raises the style quotient of your kitchen. In fact, installing mirrors on a few of your cabinets, will also strategically bring in additional light and will visually enhance the size of the room.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/7-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong></p><p><b>Play with Styles:</b> Based on the d\u00e9cor of your kitchen, there are a few simple finishes that you can work with, which will give your kitchen an instant boost in the expensive looking department. Opt for coordinated tiles on one wall, or perhaps an exposed brick wall or an open wood beam across your kitchen. Each of these styles lends an immensely high-end look to your home without burdening your pocket too much. </p><p>There are a few other things that you can consider doing as well:</p><ul><li ><p>Replace all hardware such as door handles and faucets with stylish looking options</p></li><li ><p>Bring in chic looking artwork and display them in prominent places</p></li><li ><p>Do up your open shelves with potted plants</p></li><li ><p>Install a suspended shelving unit on a wall that may be free</p></li><li ><p>Intersperse your crockery and glasses with artwork for a unique touch</p></li></ul><p><strong><strong><strong>Each of these suggestions offers a simple means to stylizing your kitchen and making it look expensive. You do not have to incorporate all ideas at once, but rather take up one or two at a time and work your way up. This further reduces the burden on your wallet and makes for a great looking kitchen.</strong></strong></strong></p><p>\u00a0</p>",

You will of course want to make the first impression on your guests, as soon as they step in. If you are looking at stylizing your entryway, you will find that there are several ways in which to do so. You may be worried about space to pull off a great design. Fact is, a fabulous set up is possible in just about any space that is available. Here are some thoughts you can work with. </p><p><strong>As with any interior designing set up, there is a systematic manner in which you should approach the design of your entryway. The first step is to empty out of the space of all that it has and take a look at what you have on hand. More often than not, the entryway is a space to hold shoes, jackets and a set of keys. If these are the things you usually have in the passage to your home, then this is your starting point. </strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/3.Samantha-Shoe-Rack_BrownOak_CreamOak.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></p><p>Based on the number of people in your home and the shoes and jackets you are thinking of stowing, you can look at an open or a closed design.

This is especially if you have children at home, with multiple sets of shoes, and toys that they like to take just before leaving home. </li><li >A stylized dressing table like space may also be created in the entryway. This can include a mirror that is attached to an extended seating place. Just below that can be drawers for your shoes. Either side of the mirror can also hold closed hanger space for your jackets. </li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/4.Rudolph_Shoe_Rack_caffe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>While there are several designs you may consider, there are also numerous themes and styles that you can work with as well.

A rather valid question since there several benefits to either options. If you are wondering on which side of the scale to lean in on, then here are some points for you to consider.</p><p>An island is the most sought after addition to a kitchen. This is especially if you have the space to include it. It acts as a room divider, a storage area, a service area, a prep area and allows you to freely move about your kitchen. It also ensures that children are kept a safe distance away from where the actual cooking is happening. </p><strong><strong></strong></strong><p>With several such benefits around, you may feel that the island is what you are looking for. However, the peninsula can prove to be equally useful. As the name suggest, one leg is attached to a wall. It is an option often see in U-shaped kitchens, a popular layout. But what is necessary to remember is the way in which you include a peninsula. </p><p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the pros and cons of each format.</p><strong><strong><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/2-compressor.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong><p><b>The Kitchen Island</b></p><p><b>Pros</b></p><ul><li ><p>The most important benefit of an island is the additional space that it makes way for. Islands come with cabinetry giving you more space to store things. Pots, pans, large appliances, and even a small bar and fridge can all be stowed away here. </p></li><li ><p>It serves as a great work area. If you plan to include a sink, it may be used to help prep for cooking. Alternately, a counter-top can serve as the space where you give final touches to a dish. It can also be a table where food is laid out and guests help themselves. Many small families use the island as a dining table as well. </p></li><li ><p>Islands come with the benefit of being customizable. This means your <b>kitchen storage</b> space can be used to hold an entire bar, complete with the glasses. Alternately you may create a stand for your recipe books. Fit in a small fridge, or create a modular space for your large appliances. Almost anything can be done in terms of altering this space. </p></li><li ><p>A home that has a kitchen island generally seems to have better resale value. </p></li><li ><p>This is the only <b>kitchen design</b> element that allows you to add a butcher\u2019s block to it. </p></li></ul><p>\u00a0<img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/3-compressor_1ffbca2c-fe28-441b-ab59-ca4c59159e44.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Cons</b></p><ul><li ><p>The possible negative aspects can be the fact that islands are primarily suited to large kitchens. They can cramp a smaller one and be more space consuming that space saving. </p></li><li ><p>They may not always be conducive to the design of your kitchen. This is especially if you plan to include an island during renovation. Water, power and drainage lines may be hindered if you introduce an island. </p></li><li ><p>If considering the island as a dining space, it limits the number of people you can seat at a time. </p></li><li ><p>It can sometimes reduce the amount of space you are perceived as having. </p></li></ul><strong><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/LARK_Straight_Kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong><p><b>The Kitchen Peninsula</b></p><p><b>Pros</b></p><ul><li ><p>A peninsula is the ideal way to have seating in your kitchen for your family. If need be, you may even have an extension built into it, to accommodate more people. This extension may be foldable and opened out for use only when needed. </p></li><li ><p>This is also the one design that allows for seating to face the stove. This makes for quicker access to food. It also ensures safety of guests. </p></li><li ><p>A peninsula is a simple way of creating more space close to the stove. This may be used to prep or plate food or in just about any way you deem fit. </p></li><li ><p>A peninsula allows you to store large appliance on the counter quite easily, keeping them close on hand. </p></li></ul><strong><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/0897/8058/files/BAYA_U-Shaped_Kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"\"></strong></strong><p><b>Cons</b></p><ul><li ><p>If not designed the right way a kitchen peninsula may have other elements of your kitchen sticking out in an unsightly manner. Your refrigerator is usually the first victim.</p></li><li ><p>It does not serve any purpose as far as additional storage is concerned. </p></li><li ><p>It can work out to be expensive, based on the materials you choose for the counter top. </p></li><li ><p>A peninsula can prove to be a deterrent as far as allowing multiple people to work in the kitchen. </p></li></ul><p><strong>It is important for you to work with your interior designer to ensure that you make the right choice for your kitchen.

This means bringing in <b>kitchen appliances</b> and finding the right place for them. Planning storage in a kitchen can be a science in itself. Your interior designer will talk to you extensively about a kitchen work triangle in order to understand how you use your kitchen.

Here are some considerations that will help put you on the right track when planning <b>kitchen storage.</b></p><p><b><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/2_1_-min.jpg\" alt=\"\"></b></p><p><b>How Necessary is the Work Triangle? </b>The basic idea of a work triangle is to ensure that you have the fridge, stove and sink at ideal distances from each other. It will help you cook more efficiently and ensure that there is no cross contamination that will take place. To make sure that your kitchen is an efficient space you do not necessarily have to have a triangle in place. </p><p>What is important is making way for a smooth workflow in the kitchen. Large kitchens can have their designated zones for work, each one being self-sufficient. In such cases, you can plan placement of appliances according to the placement of key elements in your kitchen. </p><p>For example, you can have a prep sink placed close to the refrigerator to help you wash all the veggies as soon as you get them out. It is also an ideal way to wash your hands first, before touching food. With this system in place, you can have your microwave place on the other end, perhaps closer to a main sink or to you cooking area. </p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/3_1_-min.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Every kitchen has a few appliances that are not being used too frequently.

Make sure to have this incorporated into the layout of your kitchen. This way there are no edges sticking out and hurting anyone. </p></li><li ><p>Next come your microwave and your oven. These usually range in size from 24 inches to 30 inches in breadth. When designing the platforms of your kitchen, ensure that you have the requisite depth to fit these in. Preferably one over the other. When placing these, ensure that there is a requisite amount of space between the walls or the modular kitchen cabinets for ventilation. </p></li><li ><p>Kitchens usually have a large food processor or a mixer-grinder as an essential gadget. Based on your use, this can be placed in the corner of your counter, allowing for enough room to pull it out when needed and use. Alternately, you can create modular shelving in a cabinet below and stow you blender away. </p></li><li ><p>Small gadgets like your hand blender, cup blender, etc may be placed on a metal hooks from an overhanging rod under your cabinetry. </p></li><li ><p>A coffee machine is also the norm in many houses these days. You may choose to have that placed close to your refrigerator, again in a convenient corner. This makes it easier to grab milk, cream and anything else that you may need to make the perfect come in the mornings. </p></li></ul><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/5-min_88f6c103-5f26-4fb3-864b-40e3fc33bb34.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The good thing about planning the storage of appliances in the kitchen is that there is a lot of ways to do it. Under-the-counter space is perfect for heavy appliances that are frequently used. Corners of your kitchen are ideal for those appliances that need a power point and ample space to function properly. Smaller gadgets may be placed in cabinets overhead. </p><p>What is important to remember is that you need to be honest with yourself on the number of gadgets you actually use and need space for. This will help you work with your interior designer on creating the right amount of space. </p><p><strong>Storing your appliances appropriately will ensure that they are always at hand when you need then.

Once you make up your mind, everything that doesn\u2019t matter can be dealt with. </p><p>De-cluttering \u2013 does the very thought send shivers down your spine? Does it instantly motivate you to put off the job for when you are ready for it? De-cluttering a home can bring down the best of us in one fell swoop. After all it does mean getting rid of a huge set of your belongings that you thought you needed but just don\u2019t. All of your things have an emotional attachment of some sort that just doesn\u2019t allow you to let you go. If that is not enough, the pack rat that most of us are will also conjure up a use for that stray piece of shiny paper that was stowed away more than a year ago!</p><p>De-cluttering is all about going through your belongings with a fine tooth comb and getting rid of all that you do not need. It brings about some order in your house, frees up space, lightens up an area and simply gives you more room to maneuver around it. But, getting the job done is just not easy. Here are the 5 main obstacles to de-cluttering your home and what you can do about it. </p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/2_1_-min_52faaf83-18b9-4e89-81b3-8087b395f6c3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>The Emotional Connect: </b>Most of what you tend to store away have an emotional connect. Your children may have become teenagers now, but their stuffed toys are still around. Most glasses from a set may be broken, but you hold on to the remaining few because they were a wedding gift. Letters from childhood sweethearts, gift boxes that look lovely, empty food jars that have a good design, alcohol bottles that were saved for an art project, newspapers for a collage, the list can go on and on. </p><p>As you go through each one of them, you may find yourself coming up with reasons to hang on to them. Keep in mind that the thought behind the gift will always remain with you, even when the item is way past its usability. In the case of toys and books, spreading the joy by giving it away will make you feel much better. If you haven\u2019t looked at what you have saved in over three months, then it is time for it to go. Being strong is the key here. </p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/3_1_-min_ab6918a9-49bf-4b1e-bf04-ed8645c56c60.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>\u2018I May Need It\u2019:</b> This is a conflict that most of us go through. We buy a gadget, and keep back boxes, bottles and other such knick knacks believing strongly that we will use them some day in some way. In most cases, you forget where you have kept the thing and it fades away from memory. </p><p>When you find such items, be honest with yourself and really figure out if you are going to use it or not. Most likely the answer will be no and it is important that you keep that in mind and place such things in the giveaway box. This applies to random bits of tools, boxes, papers, magazines, accessories and more. If you have managed to survive till you chanced upon this horded piece, you are most likely going to be able to manage without it. </p><p><img src=\"//res.cloudinary.com/mygubbi/image/upload/f_auto/stories/1054/3918/files/4-min_28612a28-fda7-4500-a16e-6f1d61ed984c.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><b>Too Expensive to Throw Away:</b> This is a perfectly understandable thought, especially when it comes to gadgets, appliances and other such big ticket purchases. The investment may have seemed logical at the time of purchase, but you haven\u2019t been able to make the most of it. Keeping it will only pacify you that you haven\u2019t just given away an expensive product. </p><p>What you can do, if the product is in good shape, is to try and sell it in the second hand market. This will help you recover part of the cost and will make you feel better than simply giving it away. Alternately, you could gift it to somebody who is sure to make use of it. This too will make you feel much better about getting rid of things. </p><p><b>Family Comes in the Way:</b> Have you noticed how every time you set about to de-clutter your home, a member of the family comes up to you and objects. All of the emotions you feel for a particular object, you will see reflected in every member of your family. This makes your job of de-cluttering all the more difficult. Ideally sit with each member as you go through their things. Ask them when was the last time they used the object and what could possibly happen if you got rid of it. If there is still use left in the object, you may want to consider donating it or recycling it, to help said member feel better.

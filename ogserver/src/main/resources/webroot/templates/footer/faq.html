                                        For standard products, we expect 50% of the amount to start manufacturing process.
                                        Rest can be paid once the products are finished and packaged in our warehouse for delivery.
                                        For customized orders, we follow a 10-40-50 payment policy. We expect 10% of initial budget
                                        as advance which will be adjusted against the total cost of the project later.
                                        The next 40% will be expected on finalization of the design and the last 50%
                                        will be paid once material is ready for shipment.

                                        We can swiftly deliver the product in Bangalore or nearby location.
                                        We want to make sure that we are able to deliver and install the products with safety and warranty.
                                        Hence, we don’t deliver at certain locations. But we are expanding on daily basis, do keep an eye on us.

                                        For standard products, we expect 50% of the amount to start manufacturing process.
                                        Rest can be paid once the products are finished and packaged in our warehouse for delivery.
                                        For customized orders, we follow a 10-40-50 payment policy. We expect 10% of initial budget
                                        as advance which will be adjusted against the total cost of the project later.
                                        The next 40% will be expected on finalization of the design and the last 50% will
                                        be paid once material is ready for shipment.

                    For standard products, we expect 50% of the amount to start manufacturing process. Rest can be paid once the products are finished and packaged in our warehouse for delivery.
                    For customized orders, we follow a 10-40-50 payment policy. We expect 10% of initial budget as advance which will be adjusted against the total cost of the project later. The next 40% will be expected on finalization of the design and the last 50% will be paid once material is ready for shipment.

We want to make sure that we are able to deliver and install the products with safety and warranty. Hence, we don’t deliver at certain locations. But we are expanding on daily basis, do keep an eye on us.

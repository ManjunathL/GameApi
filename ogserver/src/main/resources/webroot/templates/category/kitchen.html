        A Parallel Kitchen design makes the most of small spaces, with neat nooks for prepping and cooking

        along with overhead shelves and below counters. A U-Shaped Kitchen interior is a perfect blend of

        kitchen and dining. Workspaces are arranged along three walls, giving you an open area in the middle,

        for a dining table. The L-Shaped Kitchen design is ideal for large spaces and families. The extended

        prepping area has room for more than one cook to help put together a feast for every festival. A Straight

        Kitchen interior is true to its name and follows a linear assembly of cabinets and drawers.

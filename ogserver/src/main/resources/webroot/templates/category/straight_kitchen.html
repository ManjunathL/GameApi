    <h6 class="text-transform-none"><strong>Straight Kitchens – A Linear and Seamless Layout</strong></h6>

    <p>A general straight kitchen design follows a single-wall kitchen layout with a counter space on both sides

        of the cooking range. Straight kitchens are essentially meant for a small kitchen area. We can add

        certain element to a straight kitchen design including storage cabinets above and below. Such straight

        kitchen designs would provide easy access to kitchen appliances and everyday provisions. You can fix a

        linear arrangement of set of drawers and cabinets fixed at the lower level, which are supported by

        cabinets on top to store crockery and everyday cooking essentials, such an arrangement for any straight

        kitchen design will match up to meet the needs of any user.

                            Both physical and cognitive ergonomics are equally important to ensure a smooth workflow in your kitchen. A good work triangle ensures that you move comfortably between the sink, refrigerator and stove. This also means that there are no obstructions like an island or cabinets in the work triangle to ensure your kitchen features the best ergonomics for a clutter free kitchen workspace.
